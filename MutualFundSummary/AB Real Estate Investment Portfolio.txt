the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be
incurred under a contract, Contractholders that invest in the Portfolio should
refer to the variable contract prospectus for a description of fees and
expenses that apply to Contractholders. Inclusion of these charges would
increase the fees and expenses provided below.

EXAMPLES
The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume
that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated and
then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also
assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio's
operating expenses stay the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or
lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or
sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These transaction costs, which are
not reflected in the Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples,
affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 59% of the average value of its
portfolio.


PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES
Under normal circumstances, the Portfolio invests at least 80% of its net
assets in the equity securities of real estate investment trusts, or REITs, and
other real estate industry companies, such as real estate operating companies,
or REOCs. The Portfolio seeks to invest in real estate companies whose
underlying portfolios are diversified geographically and by property type.

The Portfolio's investment policies emphasize investment in companies
determined by the Adviser to be undervalued relative to their peers. In
selecting real estate equity securities, the Adviser uses its fundamental and
quantitative research to seek to identify companies where the magnitude and
growth of cash flow streams have not been appropriately reflected in the price
of the security. These securities may trade at a more attractive valuation than
others that may have similar overall fundamentals. The Adviser's fundamental
research efforts are focused on forecasting the short- and long-term normalized
cash generation capability of real estate companies by isolating supply and
demand for property types in local markets, determining the replacement value
of properties, assessing future development opportunities, and normalizing
capital structures of real estate companies.

<PAGE>




The Portfolio may invest in short-term investment-grade debt securities and
other fixed-income securities.


The Portfolio invests in equity securities that include common stock, shares of
beneficial interests of REITs and securities with common stock characteristics,
such as preferred stock or convertible securities ("real estate equity
securities"). The Portfolio may invest in foreign securities and enter into
forward commitments and standby commitment agreements.

Currencies can have a dramatic impact on equity returns, significantly adding
to returns in some years and greatly diminishing them in others. Currency and
equity positions are evaluated separately. The Adviser may seek to hedge the
currency exposure resulting from securities positions when it finds the
currency exposure unattractive. To hedge all or a portion of its currency risk,
the Portfolio may, from time to time, invest in currency-related derivatives,
including forward currency exchange contracts, futures contracts, options on
futures contracts, swaps and options. The Adviser may also seek investment
opportunities by taking long or short positions in currencies through the use
of currency-related derivatives.

The Portfolio may enter into other derivatives transactions, such as options,
futures contracts, forwards and swaps. The Portfolio may use options strategies
involving the purchase and/or writing of various combinations of call and/or
put options, including on individual securities and stock indices, futures
contracts (including futures contracts on individual securities and stock
indices) or shares of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. These transactions may be
used, for example, to earn extra income, to adjust exposure to individual
securities or markets, or to protect all or a portion of the Portfolio's
portfolio from a decline in value, sometimes within certain ranges.

The Portfolio may, at times, invest in shares of ETFs in lieu of making direct
investments in equity securities. ETFs may provide more efficient and
economical exposure to the type of companies and geographic locations in which
the Portfolio seeks to invest than direct investments.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
.  MARKET RISK: The value of the Portfolio's assets will fluctuate as the stock
   or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline,
   sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or
   other events that affect large portions of the market.

.  INTEREST RATE RISK: Changes in interest rates will affect the value of
   investments in fixed-income securities. When interest rates rise, the value
   of existing investments in fixed-income securities tends to fall and this
   decrease in value may not be offset by higher income from new investments.
   The Portfolio may be subject to heightened interest rate risk due to rising
   rates as the current period of historically low interest rates may be
   ending. Interest rate risk is generally greater for fixed-income securities
   with longer maturities or durations.


.  CREDIT RISK: An issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the
   counterparty to a derivatives or other contract, may be unable or unwilling
   to make timely payments of interest or principal, or to otherwise honor its
   obligations. The issuer or guarantor may default, causing a loss of the full
   principal amount of a security and accrued interest. The degree of risk for
   a particular security may be reflected in its credit rating. There is the
   possibility that the credit rating of a fixed-income security may be
   downgraded after purchase, which may adversely affect the value of the
   security. Investments in fixed-income securities with lower ratings tend to
   have a higher probability that an issuer will default or fail to meet its
   payment obligations.


.  REAL ESTATE RISK: The Portfolio's investments in the real estate market have
   many of the same risks as direct ownership of real estate, including the
   risk that the value of real estate could decline due to a variety of factors
   that affect the real estate market generally. Investments in REITs may have
   additional risks. REITs are dependent on the capability of their managers,
   may have limited diversification, and could be significantly affected by
   changes in tax laws.



.  DERIVATIVES RISK: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and
   leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the
   Portfolio, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than
   more traditional investments.

.  LEVERAGE RISK: To the extent the Portfolio uses leveraging techniques, its
   net asset value, or NAV, may be more volatile because leverage tends to
   exaggerate the effect of changes in interest rates and any increase or
   decrease in the value of the Portfolio's investments.

.  FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) RISK: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
   involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate
   more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic,
   political, regulatory or other factors.

.  CURRENCY RISK: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect
   the value of the Portfolio's investments or reduce its returns.

.  MANAGEMENT RISK: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is
   an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment
   techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the
   Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the
   intended results.

As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.

                                                                             27

BAR CHART AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The bar chart and performance information provide an indication of the
historical risk of an investment in the Portfolio by showing:

.  how the Portfolio's performance changed from year to year over ten years; and

.  how the Portfolio's average annual returns for one, five and ten years
   compare to those of a broad-based securities market index.

The performance information does not take into account separate account
charges. If separate account charges were included, an investor's return would
be lower. The Portfolio's past performance, of course, does not necessarily
indicate how it will perform in the future.

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or
sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These transaction costs, which are
not reflected in the Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples,
affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 45% of the average value of its
portfolio.


PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES
The Portfolio invests primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities
of established companies selected from more than 40 industries and more than 40
developed and emerging market countries. These countries currently include the
developed nations in Europe and the Far East, Canada, Australia and emerging
market countries worldwide. Under normal market conditions, the Portfolio
invests significantly (at least 40%--unless market conditions are not deemed
favorable by the Adviser) in securities of non-U.S. companies. In addition, the
Portfolio invests, under normal circumstances, in the equity securities of
companies located in at least three countries.

The Portfolio invests in companies that are determined by the Adviser to be
undervalued, using a fundamental value approach. In selecting securities for
the Portfolio's portfolio, the Adviser uses its fundamental and quantitative
research to identify companies whose stocks are priced low in relation to their
perceived long-term earnings power.

                                                                             29

<PAGE>



The Adviser's fundamental analysis depends heavily upon its internal research
staff. The research staff begins with a global research universe of
approximately 2,000 international and emerging market companies. Teams within
the research staff cover a given industry worldwide to better understand each
company's competitive position in a global context. The Adviser typically
projects a company's financial performance over a full economic cycle,
including a trough and a peak, within the context of forecasts for real
economic growth, inflation and interest rate changes. The Adviser focuses on
the valuation implied by the current price, relative to the earnings the
company will be generating five years from now, or "normalized" earnings,
assuming average mid-economic cycle growth for the fifth year.

The Portfolio's management team and other senior investment professionals work
in close collaboration to weigh each investment opportunity identified by the
research staff relative to the entire portfolio and determine the timing and
position size for purchases and sales. Analysts remain responsible for
monitoring new developments that would affect the securities they cover. The
team will generally sell a security when it no longer meets appropriate
valuation criteria, although sales may be delayed when positive return trends
are favorable.

Currencies can have a dramatic impact on equity returns, significantly adding
to returns in some years and greatly diminishing them in others. The Adviser
evaluates currency and equity positions separately and may seek to hedge the
currency exposure resulting from securities positions when it finds the
currency exposure unattractive. To hedge all or a portion of its currency risk,
the Portfolio may, from time to time, invest in currency-related derivatives,
including forward currency exchange contracts, futures contracts, options on
futures contracts, swaps and options. The Adviser may also seek investment
opportunities by taking long or short positions in currencies through the use
of currency-related derivatives.

The Portfolio may enter into other derivatives transactions, such as options,
futures contracts, forwards and swaps. The Portfolio may use options strategies
involving the purchase and/or writing of various combinations of call and/or
put options, including on individual securities and stock indices, futures
contracts (including futures contracts on individual securities and stock
indices) or shares of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. These transactions may be
used, for example, to earn extra income, to adjust exposure to individual
securities or markets, or to protect all or a portion of the Portfolio's
portfolio from a decline in value, sometimes within certain ranges.

The Portfolio may, at times, invest in shares of ETFs in lieu of making direct
investments in equity securities. ETFs may provide more efficient and
economical exposure to the type of companies and geographic locations in which
the Portfolio seeks to invest than direct investments. The Portfolio may invest
in depositary receipts, instruments of supranational entities denominated in
the currency of any country, securities of multinational companies and
"semi-governmental securities", and enter into forward commitments.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

.  MARKET RISK: The value of the Portfolio's assets will fluctuate as the stock
   or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline,
   sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or
   other events that affect large portions of the market. It includes the risk
   that a particular style of investing, such as the Portfolio's value
   approach, may underperform the market generally.


.  FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) RISK: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
   involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate
   more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic,
   political, regulatory or other factors.

.  EMERGING MARKET RISK: Investments in emerging market countries may have more
   risk because the markets are less developed and less liquid, and because
   these investments may be subject to increased economic, political,
   regulatory or other uncertainties.

.  CURRENCY RISK: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect
   the value of the Portfolio's investments or reduce its returns.

.  DERIVATIVES RISK: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and
   leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the
   Portfolio, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than
   more traditional investments.

.  LEVERAGE RISK: When the Portfolio borrows money or otherwise leverages its
   portfolio, its net asset value, or NAV, may be more volatile because
   leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of changes in interest rates and any
   increase or decrease in the value of the Portfolio's investments. The
   Portfolio may create leverage through the use of reverse repurchase
   agreements, forward commitments, or by borrowing money.

.  MANAGEMENT RISK: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is
   an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment
   techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the
   Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the
   intended results.

As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.
