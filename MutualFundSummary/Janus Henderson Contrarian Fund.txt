FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND
This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold Shares of the Fund. Each share class has different expenses, but represents an investment in the same Fund. For Class A Shares, you may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the Fund or in other Janus Henderson mutual funds. More information about these and other discounts, as well as eligibility requirements for each share class, is available from your financial professional and in the “Purchases” section on page 96 of the Fund’s Prospectus and in the “Purchases” section on page 84 of the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information. In addition, please see Appendix A – Intermediary Sales Charge Waivers and Discounts. You may also incur brokerage commissions charged by your broker or financial intermediary when buying Class N Shares of the Fund that are not reflected in the table or in the example below.

EXAMPLE:
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:
If Shares are redeemed:	1 Year	3 Years	5 Years	10 Years
Class A Shares	$ 654	$ 822	$ 1,004	$ 1,530
Class C Shares	$ 264	$ 508	$  876	$ 1,911
Class S Shares	$ 100	$ 312	$  542	$ 1,201
Class I Shares	$  57	$ 179	$  313	$  701
Class N Shares	$  52	$ 164	$  285	$  640

Portfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 116% of the average value of its portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities with the potential for long-term growth of capital. The portfolio manager seeks to invest in companies where the stock price trades at a significant discount to the portfolio manager’s estimate of fair value and whose intrinsic value the portfolio manager believes will grow over time. The Fund may invest in companies of any size, from larger, well-established companies to smaller, emerging growth companies. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities, which may include investments in emerging markets.
The portfolio manager applies a “bottom up” approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio manager looks at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Fund’s investment policies.
The Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS
The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.
Value Investing Risk.  Because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, “value” stocks may perform differently than other types of stocks and from the market as a whole, and can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time. It is also possible that a value stock will never appreciate to the extent expected by the portfolio manager.
Market Risk.  The value of the Fund’s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio manager’s belief about a company’s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund’s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.
Growth Securities Risk.  The Fund invests in companies that the portfolio manager believes have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be “growth” companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio manager’s perception of a company’s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Fund’s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, “growth” stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.

Nondiversification Risk.  The Fund is classified as nondiversified under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. This gives the Fund’s portfolio manager more flexibility to hold larger positions in a smaller number of securities. As a result, an increase or decrease in the value of a single security held by the Fund may have a greater impact on the Fund’s net asset value and total return.
Foreign Exposure Risk.  The Fund may have exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund’s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.
Securities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.
Management Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund’s performance has varied over time. Class T Shares (formerly named Class J Shares, the initial share class) of the Fund commenced operations with the Fund’s inception. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, and Class R Shares of the Fund commenced operations on July 6, 2009. Class N Shares of the Fund commenced operations on August 4, 2017.
•	The performance shown for Class T Shares is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, and Class R Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of each respective share class, without the effect of any fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class I Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class J Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class N Shares for periods prior to August 4, 2017, reflects the performance of the Fund’s Class T Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
If Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, and Class R Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to July 6, 2009, or Class N Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to August 4, 2017, the performance shown for each respective share class may have been different. The performance shown for periods following the Fund’s commencement of Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, Class N Shares, and Class R Shares reflects the fees and expenses of each respective share class, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.

The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated. The bar chart figures do not include any applicable sales charges that an investor may pay when they buy or sell Class A Shares or Class C Shares of the Fund. If sales charges were included, the returns would be lower. The table compares the Fund’s average annual returns for the periods indicated to a broad-based securities market index. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Fund’s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.
The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at janushenderson.com/performance or by calling 1-877-335-2687.

After-tax returns are calculated using distributions for the Fund’s Class T Shares (formerly named Class J Shares, the initial share class). After-tax returns are calculated using the historically highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your individual tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. The after-tax return information shown above does not apply to Fund shares held through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA.
After-tax returns are only shown for Class T Shares of the Fund. After-tax returns for the other classes of Shares will vary from those shown for Class T Shares due to varying sales charges (as applicable), fees, and expenses among the classes.

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
If you purchase Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, Class R Shares, or Class T Shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.

Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
