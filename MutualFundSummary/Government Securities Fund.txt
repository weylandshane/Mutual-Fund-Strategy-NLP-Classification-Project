(a)	The Investment Adviser has agreed, through September 30, 2019, to make payments or waive management, administration, and other fees to limit the expenses of the Adviser Shares and R6 Shares of the Fund so that the total annual operating expenses (exclusive of expense offset arrangements, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses) do not exceed an annual rate of 0.75% of the Adviser Shares’ average daily net assets and 0.35% of the R6 Shares’ average daily net assets. This reimbursement arrangement may not be changed or terminated during this time period without approval of the Fund’s Board of Trustees and may be changed or terminated by the Investment Adviser at any time after September 30, 2019.

Example
This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, you would pay the following expenses on a $10,000 investment, assuming (1) a 5% annual return, (2) the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same, (3) you redeem all of your shares at the end of the periods shown, and (4) the expense reimbursement arrangements for the Adviser Shares and R6 Shares are not continued beyond one year.
 	1 Year	3 Years	5 Years	10 Years
Fund Shares	$49	$154	$269	$604
Inst. Shares	$40	$125	$219	$493
Adviser Shares	$77	$266	$470	$1,061
R6 Shares	$36	$176	$328	$771
Portfolio Turnover
The Fund pays transaction costs, including commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares of the Fund are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance.
For the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 15% of the average value of its whole portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGY
The Fund normally invests at least 80% of its assets in government securities, U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds; Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS); mortgage-backed securities (MBS) backed by the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac); U.S. government agency collateralized mortgage obligations; securities issued by U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities; and repurchase agreements collateralized by such investments. The securities issued by U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities are supported by the credit of the issuing agency, instrumentality or corporation (which are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury), including but not limited to, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank, Private Export Funding Corp (Pefco), and the Small Business Administration. The

Fund has a target average maturity of 5-10 years. This 80% policy may be changed upon at least 60 days’ written notice to shareholders.
PRINCIPAL RISKS
Any investment involves risk, and there is no assurance that the Fund’s objective will be achieved. The Fund is actively managed and the investment techniques and risk analyses used by the Fund’s manager(s) may not produce the desired results. As you consider an investment in the Fund, you also should take into account your tolerance for the daily fluctuations of the financial markets and whether you can afford to leave your money in the Fund for long periods of time to ride out down periods. As with other mutual funds, losing money is a risk of investing in the Fund.
Credit risk should be low for the Fund because it invests primarily in securities that are considered to be of high quality. However, there is the possibility that an issuer will fail to make timely interest and principal payments on its securities or that negative market perceptions of the issuer’s ability to make such payments will cause the price of that security to decline.
The Fund is subject to the risk that the value of its investments will fluctuate because of changes in interest rates, changes in supply of and demand for fixed-income securities, or other market factors. If interest rates increase, the yield of the Fund may increase and the market value of the Fund’s securities may decline, adversely affecting the Fund’s net asset value (NAV) and total return. If interest rates decrease, the yield of the Fund may decrease. In addition, the market value of the Fund’s securities may increase, which may increase the Fund’s NAV and total return. Because the Federal Reserve has begun to raise interest rates, the Fund may face a heightened level of interest rate risk.
In addition, market developments and other factors, including a general rise in interest rates, have the potential to cause investors to move out of fixed-income securities on a large scale, which may increase redemptions from mutual funds that hold large amounts of fixed-income securities. Such a move, coupled with a reduction in the ability or willingness of dealers and other institutional investors to buy or hold fixed-income securities, may result in decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the fixed-income markets. Heavy redemptions of fixed-income mutual funds and decreased liquidity of fixed-income securities could hurt the Fund’s performance.
The Fund is subject to legislative risk, which is the risk that changes in government policies may affect the value of the investments held by the Fund in ways we cannot anticipate, and that such policies could have an adverse impact on the value of the Fund’s investments and the Fund’s NAV.
The Fund is subject to prepayment and extension risk. The Fund can invest in mortgage-backed securities. These securities make regularly scheduled payments of principal along with interest payments. In addition, mortgagors

Table of Contents
generally have the option of paying off their mortgages without penalty at any time. For example, when a mortgaged property is sold, the old mortgage is usually prepaid. Also, when interest rates fall, the mortgagor may refinance the mortgage and prepay the old mortgage. A homeowner’s default on the mortgage also may cause a prepayment of the mortgage. This unpredictability of the mortgage’s cash flow is called prepayment risk. For the investor, prepayment risk usually means that principal is received at the least opportune time. For example, when interest rates fall, homeowners may find it advantageous to refinance their mortgages and prepay principal. In this case, the investor is forced to reinvest the principal at the current lower rate. On the other hand, when interest rates rise, homeowners generally will not refinance their mortgages and prepayments will fall. This causes the average life of the mortgage to extend and be more sensitive to interest rates, which sometimes is called extension risk. In addition, the amount of principal the investor has to invest in these higher interest rates is reduced.
An investment in the Fund is not a deposit in USAA Federal Savings Bank, or any other bank, and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
PERFORMANCE
The following bar chart and table are intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the Fund. The Fund has four classes of shares: Fund Shares, Institutional Shares, Adviser Shares, and R6 Shares. The bar chart provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund and illustrates the Fund Shares class's volatility and performance from year to year for each full calendar year over the past 10 years. The table shows how the average annual total returns of the share classes for the periods indicated compared to those of the Fund's benchmark index and an additional index of funds with similar investment objectives. Performance reflects any expense limitations in effect during the periods shown.
Remember, historical performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate what will happen in the future. For the Fund’s most current performance information, log on to usaa.com or call (800) 531-USAA (8722) or (210) 531-8722.

RISK/RETURN BAR CHART
Annual Returns for Periods Ended December 31

During the periods shown in the chart:	Returns	Quarter ended
Highest Quarter Return	3.66%	December 31, 2008
Lowest Quarter Return	-2.18%	December 31, 2016
Year-to-Date Return	-0.90%	June 30, 2018
After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. In certain situations, the return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares may be higher than the other return amounts. A higher after-tax return may result when a capital loss occurs upon redemption and translates into an assumed tax deduction that benefits the shareholder. The actual after-tax returns depend on your tax situation and may differ from those shown. If you hold your shares through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as an individual retirement account (IRA) or 401(k) plan, the after-tax returns shown in the table are not relevant to you. Please note that after-tax returns are only shown for the Fund Shares and may differ for each share class.
