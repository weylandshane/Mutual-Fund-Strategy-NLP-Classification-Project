Fee Table

The following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund. In addition to the fees and expenses described below, your broker may also require you to pay brokerage commissions on purchases and sales of certain share classes of the fund.

You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the fund or certain other Fidelity® funds. More information about these and other discounts is available from your investment professional and in the "Fund Distribution" section beginning on page 29 of the prospectus. Different intermediaries may provide additional waivers or reductions of the sales charge. Please see “Sales Charge Waiver Policies Applied by Certain Intermediaries” in the “Appendix” section of the prospectus.

Shareholder fees

 	Class A 	Class M 	Class C 	Class I 	Class Z 
Maximum sales charge (load) on purchases (as a % of offering price) 	5.75% 	3.50% 	None 	None 	None 
Maximum contingent deferred sales charge (as a % of the lesser of original purchase price or redemption proceeds) 	None(a) 	None(a) 	1.00%(b) 	None 	None

Annual Operating Expenses

(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)

 	Class A 	Class M 	Class C 	Class I 	Class Z 
Management fee (fluctuates based on the fund's performance relative to a securities market index) 	0.69% 	0.69% 	0.69% 	0.69% 	0.69%

Total annual operating expenses 	1.24% 	1.54% 	1.99% 	0.93% 	0.80% 
This example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.

Let's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated and if you hold your shares:

 	Class A 	Class M 	Class C 	Class I 	Class Z 
 	Sell All

Shares 	Sell All

Portfolio Turnover

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 34% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies

Normally investing primarily in non-U.S. securities, including securities of issuers located in emerging markets.
Normally investing primarily in common stocks.
Normally investing in companies that Fidelity Management & Research Company (FMR) believes have above-average growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks).
Allocating investments across countries and regions.
Using fundamental analysis of factors such as each issuer's financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to select investments.
Principal Investment Risks

Stock Market Volatility.  Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to these developments.
Foreign Exposure.  Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market. Emerging markets can be subject to greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be extremely volatile. Foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile.
Issuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole.
"Growth" Investing.  "Growth" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than other types of stocks.
An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. You could lose money by investing in the fund.

Performance

The following information is intended to help you understand the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index over various periods of time.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries

The fund, the Adviser, Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), and/or their affiliates may pay intermediaries, which may include banks, broker-dealers, retirement plan sponsors, administrators, or service-providers (who may be affiliated with the Adviser or FDC), for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment.
