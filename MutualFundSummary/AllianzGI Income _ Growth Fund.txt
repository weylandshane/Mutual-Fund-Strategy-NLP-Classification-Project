Fees and Expenses of the Fund

The tables below describe the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in Class A shares of eligible funds that are part of the family of mutual funds sponsored by Allianz. More information about these and other discounts is available in the “Classes of Shares” section beginning on page 98 of the Fund’s prospectus or from your financial advisor. In addition, if you purchase shares through a specific intermediary, you may be subject to different sales charges including reductions in or waivers of such charges. More information about these intermediary-specific sales charge variations is available in Appendix A to the Fund’s prospectus (“Intermediary Sales Charge Discounts and Waivers”).

Examples.  The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.

Portfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund’s investment performance.

 

 

Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by investing primarily in a combination of common stocks and other equity securities, debt securities and convertible securities. The allocation of the Fund’s investments across asset classes will

Table of Contents

vary substantially from time to time. The Fund’s investments in each asset class are based upon the portfolio managers’ assessment of economic conditions and market factors, including equity price levels, interest rate levels and their anticipated direction. The portfolio managers will select common stocks by utilizing a fundamental, bottom-up research process which facilitates the early identification of issuers demonstrating the ability to improve their fundamental characteristics. It is expected that a substantial portion of the Fund’s investments in debt securities and convertible securities will be rated below investment grade or unrated and determined to be of similar quality (“high-yield securities” or “junk bonds”). The Fund may invest in issuers of any market capitalization (with a focus on $3 billion and above) and may invest a portion of its assets in non-U.S. securities (including emerging market securities). The Fund also may employ a strategy of writing (selling) call options on the common stocks it holds; such strategy is intended to enhance Fund distributions and reduce overall portfolio risk, though there is no assurance that it will succeed. In addition to equity securities (such as preferred stocks and warrants), the Fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in private placement securities (including Rule 144A securities) and may utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, options, stock index futures contracts and other derivative instruments.

 

 

Principal Risks

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first seven risks):
 

 	Market Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.
 

 	Issuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.
 

 	High Yield Risk:  High-yield or junk bonds are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, may be speculative and may decline in value due to increases in interest rates or an issuer’s deterioration or default.
 

 	Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.
 

 	Fixed Income Risk:  Fixed income (debt) securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, may be speculative and may decline in value due to changes in interest rates or an issuer’s or counterparty’s deterioration or default.
 

 	Smaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.
 

 	Derivatives Risk:  Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation.
 

 	Convertible Securities Risk:  Convertible securities are subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk, may be speculative and may decline in value due to increases in interest rates or an issuer’s deterioration or default.
 

 	Credit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.
 

 	Currency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 	Emerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.
 

 	Focused Investment Risk:  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.
 

 	Interest Rate Risk:  Fixed income securities may decline in value because of increases in interest rates.
 

 	Leveraging Risk:  Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility.
 

 	Liquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.
 

 	Management Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund’s management.
 

 	Non-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.
 

 	Turnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.

Performance Information

The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund’s average annual total returns with those of two broad-based market indexes and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund’s Class A shares, but do not reflect the impact of sales charges (loads). If they did, returns would be lower than those shown. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund’s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results for the newer class that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class, due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund’s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under “Additional Performance Information” in the Fund’s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance. Visit us.allianzgi.com for more current performance information.

After-tax returns are estimated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Class A shares only. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries

If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund, its distributor, its investment adviser or their affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.
