AB VPS DYNAMIC ASSET ALLOCATION PORTFOLIO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The Portfolio's investment objective is to maximize total return consistent
with the Adviser's determination of reasonable risk.

FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE PORTFOLIO

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold
shares of the Portfolio. Because the information does not reflect deductions at
the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be
incurred under a contract, Contractholders that invest in the Portfolio should
refer to the variable contract prospectus for a description of fees and
expenses that apply to Contractholders. Inclusion of these charges would
increase the fees and expenses provided below.

(b)In connection with the Portfolio's investments in AB Government Money Market
   Portfolio (the "Money Market Portfolio"), the Adviser has contractually
   agreed to waive its management fee from the Portfolio and/or reimburse other
   expenses of the Portfolio in an amount equal to the Portfolio's pro rata
   share of the Money Market Portfolio's effective management fee, as included
   in "Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses".

EXAMPLES

The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume
that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated and
then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also
assume that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the Portfolio's
operating expenses stay the same and that any fee waiver is in effect for only
the first year. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on
these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or
sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These transaction costs, which are
not reflected in the Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples,
affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 20% of the average value of its
portfolio.


PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES
The Portfolio invests in a globally diversified portfolio of equity and debt
securities, including exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and other financial
instruments, and expects to enter into derivatives transactions, such as
options, futures contracts, forwards, and swaps to achieve market exposure. The
Portfolio's neutral weighting, from which it will make its tactical asset
allocations, is 60% equity exposure and 40% debt exposure. Within these broad
components, the Portfolio may invest in any type of security, including common
and preferred stocks, warrants and convertible securities, government and
corporate fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies,

                                                                             43

<PAGE>


real estate-related securities and inflation-indexed securities. The Portfolio
may invest in U.S., non-U.S. and emerging market issuers. The Portfolio may
invest in securities of companies across the capitalization spectrum, including
smaller capitalization companies. The Portfolio expects its investments in
fixed-income securities to have a broad range of maturities and quality levels.
The Portfolio is expected to be highly diversified across industries, sectors
and countries, and will choose its positions from several market indices
worldwide in a manner that is intended to track the performance (before fees
and expenses) of those indices.

The Adviser will continuously monitor the risks presented by the Portfolio's
asset allocation and may make frequent adjustments to the Portfolio's exposures
to different asset classes. Using its proprietary Dynamic Asset Allocation
techniques, the Adviser will adjust the Portfolio's exposure to the equity and
debt markets, and to segments within those markets, in response to the
Adviser's assessment of the relative risks and returns of those segments. For
example, when the Adviser determines that equity market volatility is
particularly low and that, therefore, the equity markets present reasonable
return opportunities, the Adviser may increase the Portfolio's equity exposure
to as much as 80%. Conversely, when the Adviser determines that the risks in
the equity markets are disproportionately greater than the potential returns
offered, the Adviser may reduce the Portfolio's equity exposure significantly
below the target percentage or may even decide to eliminate equity exposure
altogether by increasing the Portfolio's fixed-income exposure to 100%. This
investment strategy is intended to reduce the Portfolio's overall investment
risk, but may at times result in the Portfolio underperforming the markets.

The Portfolio expects to utilize derivatives and to invest in ETFs to a
significant extent. Derivatives and ETFs may provide more efficient and
economical exposure to market segments than direct investments, and the
Portfolio's market exposures may at times be achieved almost entirely through
the use of derivatives or through the investments in ETFs. Derivatives
transactions and ETFs may also be a quicker and more efficient way to alter the
Portfolio's exposure than buying and selling direct investments. As a result,
the Adviser expects to use derivatives as one of the primary tools for
adjusting the Portfolio's exposure levels from its neutral weighting. The
Adviser also expects to use direct investments and ETFs to adjust the
Portfolio's exposure levels. In determining when and to what extent to enter
into derivatives transactions or to invest in ETFs, the Adviser will consider
factors such as the relative risks and returns expected of potential
investments and the cost of such transactions. The Adviser will consider the
impact of derivatives and ETFs in making its assessment of the Portfolio's
risks.

Currency exchange rate fluctuations can have a dramatic impact on returns,
significantly adding to returns in some years and greatly diminishing them in
others. To the extent that the Portfolio invests in non-U.S. Dollar-denominated
investments, the Adviser will integrate the risks of foreign currency exposures
into its investment and asset allocation decision making. The Adviser may seek
to hedge all or a portion of the currency exposure resulting from the
Portfolio's investments. The Adviser may also seek investment opportunities
through currencies and currency-related derivatives.

PRINCIPAL RISKS
.  MARKET RISK: The value of the Portfolio's assets will fluctuate as the stock
   or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline,
   sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or
   other events that affect large portions of the market.


.  INTEREST RATE RISK: Changes in interest rates will affect the value of
   investments in fixed-income securities. When interest rates rise, the value
   of existing investments in fixed-income securities tends to fall and this
   decrease in value may not be offset by higher income from new investments.
   The Portfolio may be subject to heightened interest rate risk due to rising
   rates as the current period of historically low interest rates may be
   ending. Interest rate risk is generally greater for fixed-income securities
   with longer maturities or durations.



.  CREDIT RISK: An issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the
   counterparty to a derivatives or other contract, may be unable or unwilling
   to make timely payments of interest or principal, or to otherwise honor its
   obligations. The issuer or guarantor may default, causing a loss of the full
   principal amount of a security and accrued interest. The degree of risk for
   a particular security may be reflected in its credit rating. There is the
   possibility that the credit rating of a fixed-income security may be
   downgraded after purchase, which may adversely affect the value of the
   security. Investments in fixed-income securities with lower ratings tend to
   have a higher probability that an issuer will default or fail to meet its
   payment obligations.


.  ALLOCATION RISK: The allocation of investments among different global asset
   classes may have a significant effect on the Portfolio's net asset value, or
   NAV, when one of these asset classes is performing more poorly than others.
   As both the direct investments and derivatives positions will be
   periodically adjusted to reflect the Adviser's view of market and economic
   conditions, there will be transaction costs that may be, over time,
   significant. In addition, there is a risk that certain asset allocation
   decisions may not achieve the desired results and, as a result, the
   Portfolio may incur significant losses.

.  FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) RISK: The Portfolio's investments in securities of
   non-U.S. issuers may involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These
   securities may fluctuate more widely in price and may be less liquid due to
   adverse market, economic, political, regulatory or other factors.

.  EMERGING MARKET RISK: Investments in emerging market countries may have more
   risk because the markets are less developed and less liquid, and because
   these investments may be subject to increased economic, political,
   regulatory or other uncertainties.

.  CURRENCY RISK: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect
   the value of the Portfolio's investments or reduce its returns.

.  ETF RISK: ETFs are investment companies. When the Portfolio invests in an
   ETF, the Portfolio bears its share of the ETF's expenses and runs the risk
   that the ETF may not achieve its investment objective.

.  DERIVATIVES RISK: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and
   leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the
   Portfolio, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than
   more traditional investments.

.  LEVERAGE RISK: When the Portfolio borrows money or otherwise leverages its
   portfolio, its NAV may be more volatile because leverage tends to exaggerate
   the effect of changes in interest rates and any increase or decrease in the
   value of the Portfolio's investments. The Portfolio may create leverage
   through the use of reverse repurchase agreements, forward commitments, or by
   borrowing money.

.  LIQUIDITY RISK: Liquidity risk occurs when certain investments become
   difficult to purchase or sell. Difficulty in selling less liquid securities
   may result in sales at disadvantageous prices affecting the value of your
   investment in the Portfolio. Causes of liquidity risk may include low
   trading volumes, large positions and heavy redemptions of Portfolio shares.

.  CAPITALIZATION RISK: Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies
   may be more volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies.
   Investments in small-capitalization companies may have additional risks
   because these companies have limited product lines, markets or financial
   resources.

.  REAL ESTATE RISK: The Portfolio's investments in real estate securities have
   many of the same risks as direct ownership of real estate, including the
   risk that the value of real estate could decline due to a variety of factors
   that affect the real estate market generally. Investments in real estate
   investment trusts, or REITs, may have additional risks. REITs are dependent
   on the capability of their managers, may have limited diversification, and
   could be significantly affected by changes in taxes.



.  MANAGEMENT RISK: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is
   an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment
   techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the
   Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the
   intended results.

As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.

BAR CHART AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The bar chart and performance information provide an indication of the
historical risk of an investment in the Portfolio by showing:

.  how the Portfolio's performance changed from year to year over the life of
   the Portfolio; and

.  how the Portfolio's average annual returns for one year, five years and
   since inception compare to those of a broad-based securities market index.

The performance information does not take into account separate account
charges. If separate account charges were included, an investor's return would
be lower. The Portfolio's past performance, of course, does not necessarily
indicate how it will perform in the future.
