Example
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example does not include any separate account or policy fees or charges imposed under the variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies for which the Portfolio is an investment option. If they were included, your costs would be higher. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated whether or not you redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects the contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement arrangement, if applicable, for the current duration of the arrangement only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Portfolio operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 98% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The Portfolio normally invests at least 80% of its assets (net assets plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in common stocks. The Portfolio primarily invests in common stocks of U.S. companies with market capitalizations that, at the time of investment, are similar to companies in the Standard & Poor's 500® Index ("S&P 500® Index”) (which ranged from $2.6 billion to $905.1 billion as of February 28, 2018) and the Russell 1000® Index (which ranged from $496.3 million to $905.1 billion as of February 28, 2018).

Investment Process: Using an objective, disciplined and broadly-applied process, MacKay Shields LLC, the Portfolio’s Subadvisor, selects securities that it believes have the most potential to appreciate, while seeking to limit exposure to risk. The Subadvisor also seeks to control the Portfolio's exposure to risk by seeking to construct a broadly-diversified portfolio of securities issued by a large number of companies, across sectors and industries using quantitative analysis to identify undervalued and overvalued securities. The Subadvisor uses a quantitative model that is designed to evaluate individual issuers and securities across multiple criteria, including valuation, momentum and market sentiment. The Subadvisor also conducts a qualitative review of the results of the quantitative analysis. In certain cases, the Subadvisor may deviate from positions or weightings suggested by the quantitative analysis to account for events and conditions that may not be quantifiable by the analysis, such as company-specific and market events. The Subadvisor evaluates the quantitative model and, from time to time, the Subadvisor may adjust the metrics and data underlying its quantitative analysis or model for a variety reasons, including, without limitation, to account for changing market, financial or economic conditions.

The Subadvisor may sell a security if, among other reasons, it no longer believes the security will contribute to meeting the investment objective of the Portfolio, if better opportunities are identified, or if it determines the initial investment expectations are not being met.

Principal Risks
You can lose money by investing in the Portfolio. An investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The investments selected by the Portfolio’s Subadvisor may underperform the market or other investments. The Portfolio may receive large purchase or redemption orders which may have adverse effects on performance if the Portfolio were required to sell securities, invest cash or hold a relatively large amount of cash at times when it would not otherwise do so.

The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio are summarized below.

Market Risk: The value of the Portfolio's investments may fluctuate because of changes in the markets in which the Portfolio invests, which could cause the Portfolio to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives and strategies. Changes in these markets may be rapid and unpredictable. From time to time, markets may experience periods of stress for potentially prolonged periods that may result in: (i) increased market volatility; (ii) reduced market liquidity; and (iii) increased redemptions of Portfolio shares. Such conditions may add significantly to the risk of volatility in the net asset value of the Portfolio's shares.

Portfolio Management Risk: The investment strategies, practices and risk analysis used by the Subadvisor may not produce the desired results. In addition, the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective, including during a period in which the Subadvisor takes temporary positions in response to unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, or other unusual or abnormal circumstances. Investments selected using quantitative methods or based on models that analyze information and data may perform differently from the market as a whole. The quantitative model used by the Subadvisor, and the investments selected based on the model, may not perform as expected. The quantitative model may contain certain assumptions in construction and implementation that may adversely affect the Portfolio’s performance. In addition, the Portfolio’s performance will reflect, in part, the Subadvisor’s ability to make active qualitative decisions and timely adjust the quantitative model, including the model’s underlying metrics and data.

Equity Securities Risk: Investments in common stocks and other equity securities are particularly subject to the risk of changing economic, stock market, industry and company conditions and the risks inherent in the portfolio managers' ability to anticipate such changes that can adversely affect the value of the Portfolio's holdings. Opportunity for greater gain often comes with greater risk of loss.

Market Capitalization Risk: To the extent the Portfolio invests in securities issued by small-, mid-, or large-cap companies, the Portfolio will be subject to the risks associated with securities issued by companies of the applicable market capitalization.  Securities of small-cap and mid-cap companies may be subject to greater price volatility, significantly lower trading volumes, cyclical, static or moderate growth prospects and greater spreads between their bid and ask prices than securities of larger companies. Smaller capitalization companies frequently rely on narrower product lines and niche markets and may be more vulnerable to adverse business or market developments.  Securities issued by larger companies may have less growth potential and may not be able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies, especially during strong economic periods.  In addition, larger companies may be less capable of responding quickly to competitive challenges and industry changes, including those resulting from improvements in technology, and may suffer sharper price declines as a result of earnings disappointments.  There is a risk that the securities issued by companies of a certain market capitalization may underperform the broader market at any given time.

Growth Stock Risk: If growth companies do not increase their earnings at a rate expected by investors, the market price of the stock may decline significantly, even if earnings show an absolute increase. Growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield that can cushion stock prices in market downturns.

Value Stock Risk: Value stocks may never reach what the Subadvisor believes is their full value or they may go down in value. In addition, different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, and therefore the Portfolio's performance may be lower or higher than that of funds that invest in other types of equity securities.

Past Performance
The following bar chart and table indicate some of the risks of investing in the Portfolio. The bar chart shows you how the Portfolio's calendar year performance has varied over the last ten years. The average annual total returns table shows how the Portfolio’s average annual total returns for the one-, five- and ten-year periods compare to those of two broad-based securities market indices. Separate variable annuity and variable universal life insurance account and policy fees and charges are not reflected in the bar chart and table. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. The Portfolio has selected the S&P 500® Index as its primary benchmark. The S&P 500® Index is widely regarded as the standard index for measuring large-cap U.S. stock market performance. The Portfolio has selected the Russell 1000® Index as its secondary benchmark. The Russell 1000® Index measures the performance of the large-cap segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is a subset of the Russell 3000® Index and includes approximately 1,000 of the largest companies based on a combination of their market cap and current index membership.

Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Portfolio will perform in the future.

How to Purchase and Sell Shares
Shares of the Portfolio are currently offered to certain separate accounts to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation ("NYLIAC") and may also be offered to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by other insurance companies. Shares of the Portfolio are also offered as underlying investments of the MainStay VP Asset Allocation Portfolios ("Asset Allocation Portfolios").

Individual investors do not transact directly with the Portfolio to purchase and redeem shares. Rather, investors select underlying investment options offered by the applicable policy. Please refer to the prospectus for the variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy that offers the Portfolio as an underlying investment option for information on the allocation of premium payments and on transfers among the investment divisions of the separate account.

Tax Information
Because the Portfolio's shareholders are the separate accounts of NYLIAC or other insurance companies through which you purchased your variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy and the Asset Allocation Portfolios, no discussion is included here as to the federal income tax consequences at the shareholder level. For information concerning the federal income tax consequences to variable annuity and variable universal life insurance policy owners, consult the prospectus relating to the appropriate policy.

Compensation to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
The Portfolio and/or its related companies may pay NYLIAC or other participating insurance companies, broker/dealers, or other financial intermediaries for the sale of Portfolio shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker/dealer or other financial intermediary or your sales person to recommend a policy that offers this Portfolio over another investment. Ask your individual salesperson or visit your broker/dealer’s or other financial intermediary firm’s website for more information. For additional information about these payments, please see the section entitled "The Fund and its Management" in the Prospectus.
