Fund Summary

Fund:
Fidelity Flexâ„  Conservative Income Bond Fund
Investment Objective

The fund seeks to obtain a high level of current income consistent with preservation of capital.

Fee Table

The following table describes the fees and expenses that may be incurred when you buy and hold shares of the fund.

Shareholder fees

(fees paid directly from your investment) 	None 
Annual Operating Expenses

(expenses that you pay each year as a % of the value of your investment)

Management fee 	None 
Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) fees 	None 
Other expenses(a) 	0.00% 
Total annual operating expenses(b) 	0.00% 
(a)  Based on estimated amounts for the current fiscal year.

(b)  The fund is available only to certain fee-based accounts offered by Fidelity. Managed account clients, retirement plans, plan sponsors and/or plan participants pay a wrap fee that covers investment advisory and administrative services.

This example helps compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds.

Let's say, hypothetically, that the annual return for shares of the fund is 5% and that your shareholder fees and the annual operating expenses for shares of the fund are exactly as described in the fee table. This example illustrates the effect of fees and expenses, but is not meant to suggest actual or expected fees and expenses or returns, all of which may vary. This example does not include any fees paid at the fee-based account or plan level. For every $10,000 you invested, here's how much you would pay in total expenses if you sell all of your shares at the end of each time period indicated:

1 year 	$0 
3 years 	$0 
Portfolio Turnover

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's performance. For the period from May 31, 2018 to August 31, 2018, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 10% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies

Normally investing at least 80% of assets in U.S. dollar-denominated money market and high quality investment-grade debt securities of all types, and repurchase agreements for those securities.
Potentially entering into reverse repurchase agreements.
Investing up to 5% of assets in lower quality investment-grade securities.
Managing the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. 3-6 Month Treasury Bill Index.
Normally maintaining a dollar-weighted average maturity of 0.75 years or less.
Normally investing in fixed rate securities with a maximum maturity of two years or less and floating rate securities with a maximum maturity of three years or less.
Allocating assets across different market sectors and maturities.
Investing more than 25% of total assets in the financial services industries.
Investing in domestic and foreign issuers.
Analyzing the credit quality of the issuer, security-specific features, current and potential future valuation, and trading opportunities to select investments.
Principal Investment Risks

Interest Rate Changes.  Interest rate increases can cause the price of a debt or money market security to decrease.
Foreign Exposure.  Foreign markets can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can perform differently from the U.S. market.
Financial Services Concentration.  Changes in government regulation and interest rates and economic downturns can have a significant negative effect on issuers in the financial services sector, including the price of their securities or their ability to meet their payment obligations.
Prepayment.  The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if interest rates change.
Issuer-Specific Changes.  The value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the credit quality of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening structure for a security can cause the price of a security to decrease.
An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. You could lose money by investing in the fund.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries

The Adviser, Fidelity Distributors Corporation (FDC), and/or their affiliates may pay intermediaries, which may include banks, broker-dealers, retirement plan sponsors, administrators, or service-providers (who may be affiliated with the Adviser or FDC), for the sale of fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing your intermediary and your investment professional to recommend the fund over another investment. Currently, the Board of Trustees of the fund has not authorized such payments for shares of the fund. Ask your investment professional or visit your intermediary's web site for more information.
