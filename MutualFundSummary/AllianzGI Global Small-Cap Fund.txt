Examples.  The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.

Portfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund’s investment performance.

 

 

Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in companies with market capitalizations comparable to those of companies included in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index (between $[    ] million and $[    ] billion as of June 30, 2018). Under normal market and other conditions, the Fund expects to maintain a weighted-average market capitalization between 50% and 200% of the weighted-average market capitalization of the securities in the MSCI World Small-Cap Index, which as of June 30, 2018 would permit the Fund to maintain a weighted- average market capitalization ranging from $[    ] billion to $[    ] billion. The Fund normally will allocate its investments among securities of

 	issuers located in at least eight different countries (which may include the U.S.) and expects that the majority of its non-U.S. investments will normally be in Japan and Western Europe. The Fund will normally invest no more than 25% of its assets in issuers located in any one country outside the U.S., other than France, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom. The Fund may invest up to 30% of its assets in emerging market securities (but no more than 10% in any one emerging market country). Regional portfolio managers in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Asia (ex-Japan) collaborate to produce a portfolio that is believed likely to have the best investment opportunities from each of those regions. The allocation of Fund assets among these four regions is set from time to time and periodically adjusted through a collaborative effort among the most senior portfolio managers in the regions.
 

The portfolio managers in Europe, Japan and Asia (ex-Japan) may consider the anticipated economic growth rate, political outlook, current and forecasted inflation rates, currency outlook and interest rate environment to help identify countries and other geographies within the applicable region that are likely to offer the best investment opportunities. Although there are differences in the processes used by regional teams, in general, when evaluating individual issuers, the portfolio managers in Europe and Asia (both Japan and ex-Japan) ordinarily look for the following characteristics: higher than average growth and strong potential for capital appreciation; substantial capacity for growth in revenue through either an expanding market or market share; a strong balance sheet; superior management; and differentiated or superior products and services or a steady stream of new products and services.

 

The portfolio managers in the U.S. follow a disciplined, fundamental bottom-up research process focusing on North American companies with sustainable growth characteristics that are undergoing positive fundamental change. The portfolio managers look for what they believe to be the best risk-reward candidates within the investment universe, defined as equities that are expected to appreciate based on accelerating fundamental performance and related increases in valuation multiples. Company-specific research includes industry and competitive analysis, revenue model analysis, profit analysis and balance sheet assessment. Once the portfolio managers in the U.S. believe that positive fundamental change is occurring and will likely lead to accelerating fundamental performance, they seek evidence that performance will be a longer-term sustainable trend. Lastly, these portfolio managers determine if the investment is timely with regard to relative valuation and price strength, exploiting stocks that are under-priced relative to their potential.

 

In addition to common stocks and other equity securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants), the Fund may invest in securities issued in initial public offerings (IPOs) and real estate investment trusts (REITs), and may utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, options, stock index futures contracts and other derivative instruments. Although the Fund did not invest significantly in derivative instruments as of the most recent fiscal year end, it may do so at any time.

 

 

Principal Risks

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first six risks):
 

Market Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.

 

Issuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.

 

Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.

 

Non-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.

 

Emerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.

 

Smaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.

 

Credit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.

 

Currency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.

 

Derivatives Risk:  Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation.

Focused Investment Risk:  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.

 

IPO Risk:  Securities purchased in initial public offerings have no trading history, limited issuer information and increased volatility.

 

Leveraging Risk:  Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility.

 

Liquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.

 

Management Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund’s management.

 

REIT and Real Estate-Related Investment Risk:  Adverse changes in the real estate markets may affect the value of REIT investments or real estate-linked derivatives.

 

Turnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.

 

Please see “Summary of Principal Risks” in the Fund’s prospectus for a more detailed description of the Fund’s risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

 

 

Performance Information

The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund’s average annual total returns with those of a broad-based market index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund’s Class A shares, but do not reflect the impact of sales charges (loads). If they did, returns would be lower than those shown. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund’s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. Similarly, for periods prior to a reorganization of the Fund, in which a predecessor fund was merged into the Fund, the performance information is based on the performance of the predecessor fund, adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the particular share class of the Fund. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class and/or the predecessor fund, as the case may be, due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund’s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under “Additional Performance Information” in the Fund’s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance. Visit us.allianzgi.com for more current performance information.

After-tax returns are estimated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Class A shares only. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary.
