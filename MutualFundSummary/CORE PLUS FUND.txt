Purchases of $1 million or more may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge of 1.00% if the shares are redeemed within one year of the date of the purchase.
3 
The advisor will waive the portion of the fund’s management fee equal to the expenses attributable to the management fees of the American Century funds in which the fund invests. The amount of this waiver fluctuates depending on the fund’s daily allocation to other American Century funds. This waiver is expected to remain in effect permanently and it cannot be terminated without the approval of the Board of Trustees.
4  
The advisor also agreed to waive an additional 0.10 percentage points of the fund’s management fee. The advisor expects this fee waiver to continue until July 31, 2019 and cannot terminate it prior to such date without the approval of the Board of Trustees.
Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods and that you earn a 5% return each year. The example also assumes that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same, except that it reflects the rate and duration of any fee waivers noted in the table above. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 144% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies
The fund invests at least 65% of its assets in investment-grade, non-money market debt securities. An investment-grade security is one that has been rated by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization in its top four credit quality categories or determined by the advisor to be of comparable credit quality. Debt securities include fixed-income investments such as notes, bonds, commercial paper and U.S. Treasury securities. These securities, which may be payable in U.S. or foreign currencies, may include corporate bonds and notes, government securities and securities backed by mortgages or other assets.
The fund may invest in high-yield debt securities. A high-yield security, or junk bond, is one that has been rated below the four highest categories used by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization, or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality. The fund may also invest in securities issued by companies that are located in emerging market countries—emerging market securities. The fund may not invest more than 35% of its assets in high-yield securities and emerging market securities combined.
The fund may invest in non-dollar denominated debt securities. The weighted average maturity of the fund’s portfolio must be 3½ years or longer.
The fund may invest in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and certain U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities such as the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Ginnie Mae is supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by other U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, they are authorized to borrow from the U.S. Treasury to meet their obligations.
In addition to the debt securities described above, the fund may also invest in bank loans.
The fund also may invest in derivative instruments provided that such investments are in keeping with the fund’s investment objectives. Such derivative instruments may include options, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and swap agreements (including, but not limited to, credit default swap agreements). The fund may invest in collateralized debt obligations, including collateralized loan obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage- or asset- backed securities, and other similarly structured investments. The fund may use foreign currency exchange contracts to shift investment exposure from one currency into another for hedging purposes or to enhance returns.
To determine whether to buy or sell a security, the portfolio managers consider, among other things, various fund requirements and standards, along with economic conditions, alternative investments and interest rates.
To gain exposure to certain segments of the fixed-income market, the fund may invest in other American Century funds (affiliated funds).
The fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its principal investment strategies. This may cause higher transaction costs and may affect performance. It may also result in the realization and distribution of capital gains.
Principal Risks
•
Interest Rate Risk – Investments in debt securities are sensitive to interest rate changes. Generally, the value of debt securities and the funds that hold them decline as interest rates rise. This fund is more susceptible to interest rate changes than funds that have a shorter-weighted average maturity, such as money market and short-term bond funds. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund’s performance.
•
Credit Risk – The inability or perceived inability of a security’s issuer to make interest and principal payments may cause the value of the security to decrease. As a result the fund’s share price could also decrease. Changes in the credit rating of a debt security held by the fund could have a similar effect.

3


•
High-Yield Risk – Issuers of high-yield securities are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes (such as an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates), political changes or adverse developments specific to an issuer. These factors may be more likely to cause an issuer of low quality bonds to default on its obligations.
•
Liquidity Risk – During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, to meet redemptions it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund’s price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund’s investments.
•
Prepayment Risk – The fund may invest in debt securities backed by mortgages or other assets. If these underlying assets are prepaid, the fund may benefit less from declining interest rates than funds of similar maturity that invest less heavily in mortgage- and asset-backed securities.
•
Foreign Securities Risk – Foreign securities are generally riskier than U.S. securities. Political events (such as civil unrest, national elections and imposition of exchange controls), social and economic events (such as labor strikes and rising inflation), and natural disasters occurring in a country where the fund invests could cause the fund’s investments in that country to experience losses. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.
•
Currency Risk – Because the fund may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the fund could experience gains or losses based solely on changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.
•
Emerging Market Risk – Investing in emerging market countries generally is also riskier than investing in foreign developed countries. Emerging market countries may have unstable governments and/or economies that are subject to sudden change, and significant volatility in their financial markets. These countries also may lack the legal, business and social framework to support securities markets.
•
Derivative Risk – The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional instruments. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, and correlation risk.
•
Bank Loan Risk  – The market for bank loans may not be highly liquid and the fund may have difficulty selling them. In connection with purchasing loan participations, the fund generally will have no right to enforce compliance by borrowers with loan terms nor any set off rights, and the fund may not benefit directly from any posted collateral. As a result, the fund may be subject to the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender selling the participation. Bank loan transactions may take more than seven days to settle, meaning that proceeds would be unavailable to make additional investments or meet redemptions.
•
Collateralized Debt Obligations Risk – Collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) are subject to credit, interest rate, valuation, and prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. The market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, changes in the market value of the underlying assets held by the CLO, changes in the distributions on the underlying assets, defaults and recoveries on the underlying assets, capital gains and losses on the underlying assets, prepayments on underlying assets and the availability, prices and interest rate of underlying assets.
•
Market Risk – The value of securities owned by the fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Historical performance for the I Class prior to its inception (April 10, 2017) is based on the performance of R5 Class shares. I Class performance has been adjusted to reflect differences in expenses between classes, if applicable.
The after-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services.

Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
