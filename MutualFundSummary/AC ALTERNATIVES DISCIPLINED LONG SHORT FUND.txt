Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable

account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 243% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies
The portfolio managers initially identify an eligible universe of growth stocks and then use quantitative models in a two-step process to construct the portfolio of equity securities (principally common stocks) for the fund. In the first step, the managers rank stocks, primarily large and mid capitalization, publicly traded U.S. companies with a market capitalization greater than $2 billion, from most to least attractive by using a quantitative model that combines measures that the advisor believes are predictive of an individual stock’s performance, including valuation, quality, growth, and sentiment. In the second step, the managers use a quantitative model to build a portfolio that provides the optimal balance between risk and expected return.
The portfolio managers buy, or take long positions in, equity securities that they have identified as the most attractive and take short positions in equity securities that they have identified as the least attractive using the multi-factor quantitative model described above. A long position arises when the fund buys a security outright. A short position arises when the fund sells a security it does not own but has borrowed in anticipation that the market price of the security will decline. If the market price in fact declines, the fund can replace the borrowed security at a lower price and capture the value represented by the difference between the higher sale price and the lower replacement price. The proceeds from the securities sold short may be used to fund the purchase of additional long positions or held as cash or cash equivalents. Using such proceeds to fund the purchase of additional long positions may result in a long exposure greater than 100%. The amount of the long and short positions held by the fund may vary over time depending on prevailing market conditions. In the aggregate, the fund expects to have net long exposure to the equity markets, which the portfolio managers may adjust over time. Typically, the fund’s net exposure (long minus short positions) ranges between 30% and 70%.
The portfolio managers generally sell a stock from the fund’s long portfolio when they believe it has become less attractive relative to other opportunities, its risk characteristics outweigh its return opportunity or specific events alter its prospects.
The fund’s use of short selling as a primary investment strategy creates leverage in an attempt to increase returns.
The fund may invest a portion of its assets in foreign securities when these securities meet the portfolio managers’ standards of selection.
As part of the fund’s principal investment strategy, a significant portion of the fund’s assets may be invested in cash and cash equivalent securities. The fund’s cash holdings may vary over time as the portfolio managers adjust the fund’s net long exposure.
The fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its principal investment strategies. This may cause higher transaction costs and may affect performance. It may also result in the realization and distribution of capital gains.
Principal Risks
•
Style Risk – If at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s quantitative investment style, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other equity funds using different investment styles.
•
Investment Process Risk – Stocks selected by the portfolio managers using quantitative models may perform differently than expected due to the portfolio managers’ judgments regarding the factors used in the models, the weight placed on each factor, changes from the factors’ historical trends, and technical issues with the construction and implementation of the models (including, for example, data problems and/or software or other implementation issues). There is no guarantee that the use of the quantitative model will result in effective investment decisions for the fund. Additionally, the commonality of portfolio holdings across quantitative investment managers may amplify losses.
•
Foreign Securities – The fund may invest in foreign securities, which can be riskier than investing in U.S. securities. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. stocks.
•
Short Sales Risk – If the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security, the fund may suffer a loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Any loss will be increased by the amount of compensation, interest or dividends, and transaction costs the fund must pay to the lender of the borrowed security. In addition, because the fund’s loss on a short sale stems from increases in the value of the security sold short, the extent of such loss, like the price of the security sold short, is theoretically unlimited.
•
Leverage Risk – The fund’s investment strategy utilizes leverage, which can increase market exposure and subject the fund to greater risk and higher volatility.
•
Overweighting Risk – If the fund is overweighted in a stock or sector, any negative development related to that stock or sector will have a greater impact on the fund than other funds that are not overweighted in that stock or sector.
•
Growth Stocks – Investments in growth stocks may be more volatile than other stocks and the overall stock market. These stocks are typically priced higher than other stocks because of their growth potential, which may or may not be realized.
•
Small Cap Stocks – Though the fund invests primarily in larger companies, it may also invest in smaller companies. Investments in smaller companies may be more volatile and subject to greater risk than larger companies. Smaller companies may have limited

3


financial resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies, which could lead to higher transaction costs.
•
Cash Holdings Risk – The fund may hold a significant position in cash and cash equivalent securities. As a result, the fund may not participate in market advances or declines to the same extent that it would if the fund were more fully invested.
•
Market Risk – The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities it owns and other factors generally affecting the securities market.
•
Price Volatility – The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services for investments in all classes.
