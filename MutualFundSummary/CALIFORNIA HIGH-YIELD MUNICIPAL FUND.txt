Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor, I or Y Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 52% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The fund invests in California municipal and other debt securities with an emphasis on high-yield securities. A high-yield security is one that has been rated below investment-grade, or determined by the investment advisor to be of similar quality. Under normal market conditions, the portfolio managers invest at least 80% of the fund’s net assets in municipal securities with income payments exempt from federal and California income taxes. Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories usually issue these securities for public projects, such as schools, roads, and water and sewer systems. Some of these investments are not necessarily exempt from the federal alternative minimum tax. 
The portfolio managers seek to invest in securities that will result in a high yield for the fund. To accomplish this, the portfolio managers buy securities that are rated below investment-grade, including so-called junk bonds and bonds that are in technical or monetary default. Issuers of these securities often have short financial histories or have questionable credit or have had and may continue to have problems making interest and principal payments. 
The portfolio managers also may buy unrated securities if they determine such securities meet the investment objectives of the fund. 
Although the fund invests primarily for income, it also employs techniques designed to realize capital appreciation. For example, the portfolio managers may select bonds with maturities and coupon rates that position the fund for potential capital appreciation for a variety of reasons, including their view on the direction of future interest-rate movements and the potential for a credit upgrade.
When determining whether to sell a security, the portfolio managers consider, among other things, current and anticipated changes in interest rates, the credit quality of a particular issuer, comparable alternatives, general market conditions and any other factor deemed relevant by the portfolio managers. 
Principal Risks 
•
Credit Risk – Debt securities, even investment-grade debt securities, are subject to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that the inability or perceived inability of the issuer to make interest and principal payments will cause the value of the securities to decrease. As a result, the fund’s share price could also decrease. Changes in the credit rating of a debt security held by the fund could have a similar effect. The fund’s investments often have high credit risk, which helps the fund pursue a higher yield than more conservatively managed bond funds.
•
Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk – Issuers of lower rated, high-yield securities are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes (such as an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates), political changes, or adverse developments specific to the issuer. Adverse economic, political and other developments may be more likely to cause an issuer of low-quality bonds to default on its obligation to pay interest and principal due under its securities. The fund invests a significant part of its assets in securities rated below investment-grade or that are unrated, including bonds that are in technical or monetary default. By definition, the issuers of many of these securities have had and may continue to have problems making interest and principal payments.
•
Interest Rate Risk – When interest rates change, the fund’s share value will be affected. Generally, the value of debt securities and the funds that hold them decline as interest rates rise. Because the fund typically invests in intermediate-term and long-term bonds, the fund’s interest rate risk is generally higher than for funds with shorter-weighted average maturities, such as money market and short-term bond funds. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund’s performance.
•
California Economic Risk – The fund will be sensitive to events that affect California’s economy. Significant political or economic developments in California will likely impact virtually all municipal securities issued in the state. Because the fund invests principally in California municipal securities, it may have a higher level of risk than funds that invest in a larger universe of securities.
•
Municipal Securities Risk – Because the fund invests principally in municipal securities, it will be sensitive to events that affect municipal markets, including legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. The fund may have a higher level of risk than funds that invest in a larger universe of securities.
•
Liquidity Risk – The fund may also be subject to liquidity risk. During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, in order to meet redemptions, it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund’s share price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund’s investments.
•
Tax Risk – Some or all of the fund’s income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. There is no guarantee that all of the fund’s income will remain exempt from federal or state income taxes. Income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or non-compliant conduct of a bond issuer. The fund may sell securities that lose their tax-exempt statuses at inopportune times, which may cause tax consequences or a decrease in the fund’s value.
•
Market Risk – The value of securities owned by the fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.

Fund Performance
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. Because the Y Class does not have investment performance for a full calendar year, it is not included. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, including yields, please visit americancentury.com. 
Sales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.

Effective December 31, 2017, the fund’s investment advisor selected a different benchmark for comparison purposes. The advisor believes the S&P Municipal Bond California 50% Investment Grade/50% High Yield Index is more reflective of the fund’s strategy. Because the S&P Municipal Bond California 50% Investment Grade/50% High Yield Index total return data is first available as of December 30, 2011, returns for the Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index are also shown to cover the 10 year period.
After-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.

Tax Information
The fund intends to distribute income that is exempt from regular federal and California income tax, however, fund distributions may be subject to capital gains tax. A portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal and/or California income taxes or to the federal alternative minimum tax.
If you hold your fund shares through a tax-deferred investment plan, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, any distributions received from the fund may be taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal from the tax-deferred plan, regardless of whether the distributions were tax-exempt when earned. 
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services for investments in all classes except the Y Class. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
