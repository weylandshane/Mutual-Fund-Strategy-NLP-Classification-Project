INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The Portfolio's investment objective is long-term growth of capital.

FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE PORTFOLIO

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold
shares of the Portfolio. Because the information does not reflect deductions at
the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be
incurred under a contract, Contractholders that invest in the Portfolio should
refer to the variable contract prospectus for a description of fees and
expenses that apply to Contractholders. Inclusion of these charges would
increase the fees and expenses provided below.

EXAMPLES
The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume
that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated and
then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also
assume that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio's
operating expenses stay the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or
lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or
sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These transaction costs, which are
not reflected in the Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples,
affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 40% of the average value of its
portfolio.


PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES
The Portfolio pursues opportunistic growth by investing in a global universe of
companies in multiple industries that may benefit from innovation.

The Adviser employs a combination of "top-down" and "bottom-up" investment
processes with the goal of identifying the most attractive securities
worldwide, fitting into broader themes, which are developments that have broad
effects across industries and companies. Drawing on its global fundamental
research capabilities, the Adviser seeks to identify long-term secular growth
trends that will affect multiple industries. The Adviser will assess the
effects of these trends on entire industries and on individual companies.
Through this process, the Adviser intends to identify key investment themes,
which will be the focus of the Portfolio's investments and which are expected
to change over time based on the Adviser's research.

In addition to this "top-down" thematic approach, the Adviser will also use a
"bottom-up" analysis of individual companies that focuses on prospective
earnings growth, valuation and quality of company management. The Adviser
normally considers a large universe of mid- to large-capitalization companies
worldwide for investment.

The Portfolio invests in securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. companies from
multiple industry sectors in an attempt to maximize opportunity, which should
also tend to reduce risk. The Portfolio invests in both developed and emerging
market countries. Under normal market conditions, the Portfolio invests
significantly (at least 40%--unless market conditions are not deemed favorable
by the Adviser) in securities of non-U.S. companies. In addition, the Portfolio
invests, under normal circumstances, in the equity securities of companies
located in at least three countries. The percentage of the Portfolio's assets
invested in securities of companies in a particular country or denominated in a
particular currency varies in accordance with the Adviser's assessment of the
appreciation potential of such securities.

The Portfolio may invest in any company and industry and in any type of equity
security, listed and unlisted, with potential for capital appreciation. It
invests in well-known, established companies as well as new, smaller or
less-seasoned companies. Investments in new, smaller or less-seasoned companies
may offer more reward but may also entail more risk than is generally true of
larger, established companies. The Portfolio may also invest in synthetic
foreign equity securities, which are various types of warrants used
internationally that entitle a holder to buy or sell underlying securities,
real estate investment trusts and zero-coupon bonds.

The Portfolio may, at times, invest in shares of exchange-traded funds, or
ETFs, in lieu of making direct investments in equity securities. ETFs may
provide more efficient and economical exposure to the type of companies and
geographic locations in which the Portfolio seeks to invest than direct
investments.

Currencies can have a dramatic impact on equity returns, significantly adding
to returns in some years and greatly diminishing them in others. Currency and
equity positions are evaluated separately. The Adviser may seek to hedge the
currency exposure resulting from securities positions when it finds the
currency exposure unattractive. To hedge all or a portion of its currency risk,
the Portfolio may, from time to time, invest in currency-related derivatives,
including forward currency exchange contracts, futures contracts, options on
futures contracts, swaps and options. The Adviser may also seek investment
opportunities by taking long or short positions in currencies through the use
of currency-related derivatives.

The Portfolio may enter into other derivatives transactions, such as options,
futures contracts, forwards and swaps. The Portfolio may use options strategies
involving the purchase and/or writing of various combinations of call and/or
put options, including on individual securities and stock indices, futures
contracts (including futures contracts on individual securities and stock
indices) or shares of ETFs. These transactions may be used, for example, to
earn extra income, to adjust exposure to individual securities or markets, or
to protect all or a portion of the Portfolio's portfolio from a decline in
value, sometimes within certain ranges.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

.  MARKET RISK: The value of the Portfolio's assets will fluctuate as the stock
   or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline,
   sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or
   other events that affect large portions of the market. It includes the risk
   that a particular style of investing, such as the Portfolio's growth
   approach, may underperform the market generally.


.  FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) RISK: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
   involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate
   more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic,
   political, regulatory or other factors.

.  EMERGING MARKET RISK: Investments in emerging market countries may have more
   risk because the markets are less developed and less liquid, and because
   these investments may be subject to increased economic, political,
   regulatory or other uncertainties.

.  CURRENCY RISK: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect
   the value of the Portfolio's investments or reduce its returns.


.  CAPITALIZATION RISK: Investments in mid-capitalization companies may be more
   volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies. Investments in
   mid-capitalization companies may have additional risks because these
   companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources.


.  DERIVATIVES RISK: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and
   leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the
   Portfolio, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than
   more traditional investments.

.  FOCUSED PORTFOLIO RISK: Investments in a limited number of companies may
   have more risk because changes in the value of a single security may have a
   more significant effect, either negative or positive, on the Portfolio's net
   asset value, or NAV.

.  LEVERAGE RISK: To the extent the Portfolio uses leveraging techniques, its
   NAV may be more volatile because leverage tends to exaggerate the effect of
   changes in interest rates and any increase or decrease in the value of the
   Portfolio's investments.

.  MANAGEMENT RISK: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is
   an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment
   techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the
   Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the
   intended results.

As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.

BAR CHART AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The bar chart and performance information provide an indication of the
historical risk of an investment in the Portfolio by showing:

.  how the Portfolio's performance changed from year to year over ten years; and

.  how the Portfolio's average annual returns for one, five and ten years
   compare to those of a broad-based securities market index.

The performance information does not take into account separate account
charges. If separate account charges were included, an investor's return would
be lower. The Portfolio's past performance, of course, does not necessarily
indicate how it will perform in the future.
