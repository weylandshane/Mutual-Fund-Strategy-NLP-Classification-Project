FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. You may be required to pay commissions and/or other forms of compensation to a broker for transactions in Advisor Class shares, which are not reflected in the tables or the examples below.

Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)

None

Annual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)

 

 	 	Advisor Class
Management Fees(a)	 	 	.05	%
Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees	 	 	None	 
Other Expenses:	 	 	 	 
Transfer Agent	 	 	.11	%
Other Expenses(b)	 	 	33.76	%
 	 	 	 	 
Total Other Expenses	 	 	33.87	%
Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses	 	 	.02	%
 	 	 	 	 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses Before Waiver	 	 	33.94	%
 	 	 	 	 
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement(c)	 	 	(33.84	)%
 	 	 	 	 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement	 	 	.10	%
 	 	 	 	 
(a)	The management fee paid to the Adviser consists of a base fee at an annualized rate of 0.55% of the Fund’s average daily net assets and a positive or negative performance adjustment of up to an annualized rate of 0.50% based upon the Fund’s performance relative to the Russell 1000 Growth Index, resulting in a minimum total fee of 0.05% and a maximum total fee of 1.05%. The management fee shown above is based on the fee accrued as of December 31, 2017; the actual management fee to be paid by the Fund will depend on the performance of the Fund from its inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018.
(b)	Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, which reflect only those initial offering costs being amortized during the current fiscal year. (Offering costs are amortized for a one-year period following commencement of operations.) If prior fiscal year offering costs had been included, Other Expenses would have been 36.88%.
(c)	The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or to bear expenses of the Fund through April 30, 2019 to the extent necessary to prevent Total Other Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses other than the advisory fees of any AB Mutual Funds in which the Fund may invest, interest expense, taxes, extraordinary expenses, and brokerage commissions and other transaction costs), on an annualized basis, from exceeding 0.05% of average daily net assets (“expense limitation”). Any fees waived and expenses borne by the Adviser may be reimbursed by the Fund until the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal period in which the fee was waived or the expense was borne, provided that no reimbursement payment will be made that would cause the Fund’s Total Other Expenses to exceed the expense limitation. In connection with the Fund’s investments in AB Government Money Market Portfolio (the “Money Market Portfolio”), the Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee from the Fund and/or reimburse other expenses of the Fund in an amount equal to the Fund’s pro rata share of the Money Market Portfolio’s effective management fee, as included in “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses”.
Examples

The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the Fund’s operating expenses stay the same (except for the exclusion of offering costs after the first year) and that any fee waiver and/or expense limitation is in effect through the date indicated above. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

 

 	 	Advisor Class
After 1 Year	 	$	10	 
After 3 Years	 	$	4,927	 
After 5 Years	 	$	7,624	 
After 10 Years	 	$	10,170

Portfolio Turnover

The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These transaction costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples, affect the Fund’s performance. During the fiscal period from Fund inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 25% of the average value of its portfolio.

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

The Fund invests primarily in equity securities of a limited number of large, carefully selected, high-quality U.S. companies. The Fund invests primarily in the domestic equity securities of companies selected by the Fund’s Adviser for their growth potential within various market sectors. The Fund emphasizes investments in large, seasoned companies. Under normal circumstances, the Fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in common stocks of large-capitalization companies.

For these purposes, “large-capitalization companies” are those that, at the time of investment, have market capitalizations within the range of market capitalizations of companies appearing in the Russell 1000® Growth Index. While the market capitalizations of companies in the Russell 1000® Growth Index ranged from approximately $1.28 billion to $851 billion as of March 31, 2018, the Fund normally will invest in common stocks of companies with market capitalizations of at least $5 billion at the time of purchase.

The Adviser expects that normally the Fund’s portfolio will tend to emphasize investments in securities issued by U.S. companies, although it may invest in foreign securities.

The investment team allocates the Fund’s investments among broad sector groups based on the fundamental company research conducted by the Adviser’s internal research staff, assessing the current and forecasted investment opportunities and conditions, as well as diversification and risk considerations. The investment team may vary the percentage allocations among market sectors and may change the market sectors in which the Fund invests as companies’ potential for growth within a sector matures and new trends for growth emerge.

The Adviser’s research focus is in companies with high sustainable growth prospects, high or improving return on invested capital, transparent business models, and strong and lasting competitive advantages.

The Fund may enter into derivatives transactions, such as options, futures contracts, forwards and swaps. The Fund may use options strategies involving the purchase and/or writing of various combinations of call and/or put options, including on individual securities and stock indices, futures contracts (including futures contracts on individual securities and stock indices) or shares of exchange-traded funds. These transactions may be used, for example, in an effort to earn extra income, to adjust exposure to individual securities or markets, or to protect all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio from a decline in value, sometimes within certain ranges.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

•	Market Risk: The value of the Fund’s assets will fluctuate as the stock or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or other events that affect large portions of the market. It includes the risk that a particular style of investing, such as the Fund’s growth approach, may underperform the market generally.
•	Foreign (Non-U.S.) Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic, political, regulatory or other factors.
•	Derivatives Risk: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the Fund, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than more traditional investments.
 

•	Management Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the intended results.
As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Fund.

(b)	Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, which reflect only those initial offering costs being amortized during the current fiscal year. (Offering costs are amortized for a one-year period following commencement of operations.) If prior fiscal year offering costs had been included, Other Expenses would have been 37.37%.
(c)	The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or to bear expenses of the Fund through April 30, 2019 to the extent necessary to prevent Total Other Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses other than the advisory fees of any AB Mutual Funds in which the Fund may invest, interest expense, taxes, extraordinary expenses, and brokerage commissions and other transaction costs), on an annualized basis, from exceeding 0.05% of average daily net assets (“expense limitation”). Any fees waived and expenses borne by the Adviser may be reimbursed by the Fund until the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal period in which the fee was waived or the expense was borne, provided that no reimbursement payment will be made that would cause the Fund’s Total Other Expenses to exceed the expense limitation. In connection with the Fund’s investments in AB Government Money Market Portfolio (the “Money Market Portfolio”), the Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee from the Fund and/or reimburse other expenses of the Fund in an amount equal to the Fund’s pro rata share of the Money Market Portfolio’s effective management fee, as included in “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses”.

Portfolio Turnover

The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These transaction costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples, affect the Fund’s performance. During the fiscal period from Fund inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 22% of the average value of its portfolio.

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

The Fund pursues opportunistic growth by investing primarily in a portfolio of U.S. companies. Under normal conditions, the Fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in equity securities of U.S. companies and related derivatives.

The Adviser employs a combination of “top-down” and “bottom-up” investment processes with the goal of identifying the most attractive U.S. securities, fitting into broader themes, which are developments that have broad effects across industries and companies. Drawing on its fundamental research capabilities, the Adviser seeks to identify long-term secular growth trends (often resulting from innovation) that will affect multiple industries. The Adviser will assess the effects of these trends on entire industries and on individual companies. Through this process, the Adviser intends to identify key investment themes, which will be the focus of the Fund's investments and which are expected to change over time based on the Adviser's research.

In addition to this “top-down” thematic approach, the Adviser will also use a “bottom-up” analysis of individual companies that focuses on prospective earnings growth, valuation and quality of company management. The Adviser normally considers a universe of primarily U.S. mid- to large-capitalization companies for investment.

The Adviser expects that normally the Fund’s portfolio will emphasize investments in securities issued by U.S. companies, although it may invest in foreign securities.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

•	Market Risk: The value of the Fund’s assets will fluctuate as the stock or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or other events that affect large portions of the market. It includes the risk that a particular style of investing, such as the Fund’s growth approach, may underperform the market generally.
•	Foreign (Non-U.S.) Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic, political, regulatory or other factors.
•	Capitalization Risk: Investments in mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies. Investments in mid-capitalization companies may have additional risks because these companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources.
 

•	Management Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the intended results.
As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
