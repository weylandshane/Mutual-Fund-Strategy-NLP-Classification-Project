Examples.  The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.

Portfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund’s investment performance.

 

 

Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in securities of companies that are tied economically to countries with emerging securities markets–that is, countries with securities markets that are, in the opinion of the portfolio managers, less sophisticated than more developed markets in terms of participation by investors, analyst

coverage, liquidity and/or regulation. The Fund will normally invest primarily in companies located in the countries represented in the Fund’s benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index (“Emerging Market Countries”), and have exposure to at least 5 Emerging Market Countries. The portfolio managers seek to invest in emerging markets equities which they believe are benefiting from change not yet fully reflected in the market. Members of the portfolio management team believe that behavioral biases of investors contribute to market inefficiencies. Their quantitative investment process begins with a proprietary investment-return forecasting model which combines behavioral factors (which seek to capitalize on human behavioral biases (i.e., systematic tendencies) from financial analysts, company management and investors), with intrinsic and valuation factors (which are expected to provide tangible measures of a company’s true worth). The portfolio managers integrate this multi-factor approach with a proprietary risk model to form the basis of portfolio construction, with constraints at the individual security, country and industry levels to manage exposures relative to the benchmark. Additionally, all investment recommendations are thoroughly vetted on an individual company level to confirm the investment rationale and suitability before a purchase or sale. The Fund normally invests primarily in common stocks, either directly or indirectly through depositary receipts. In addition to common stocks, equity securities in which the Fund may invest include, without limitation, preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants. The Fund may invest in issuers of any size market capitalization, including smaller capitalization companies. The Fund may utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, options, stock index futures contracts and other derivative instruments. The Fund may also use participatory notes (“P-Notes”) or other equity-linked notes to gain exposure to issuers in certain countries. Although the Fund did not invest significantly in derivative instruments as of the most recent fiscal year end, it may do so at any time.

 

 

Principal Risks

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first seven risks):
 

 	Market Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.
 

 	Issuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.
 

 	Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.
 

 	Non-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.
 

 	Emerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.
 

 	Focused Investment Risk:  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.
 

 	Smaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.
 

 	Credit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.
 

 	Currency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 	Derivatives Risk:  Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation.
 

 	Leveraging Risk:  Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility.
 

 	Liquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.
 

 	Management Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund’s management.
 

 	Turnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.

Performance Information

The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund’s average annual total returns with those of a broad-based market index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund’s Institutional Class shares. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges (loads). For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund’s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. Similarly, for periods prior to a reorganization of the Fund, in which a predecessor fund was merged into the Fund, the performance information is based on the performance of the predecessor fund, adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the particular share class of the Fund. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class and/or the predecessor fund, due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund’s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under “Additional Performance Information” in the Fund’s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance. Visit us.allianzgi.com for more current performance information.

After-tax returns are estimated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares
