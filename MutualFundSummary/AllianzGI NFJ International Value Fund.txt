Examples.  The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.

Portfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund’s investment performance.

Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by normally investing at least 65% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in common stocks and other equity securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants) of non-U.S. companies with market capitalizations greater than $1 billion. The Fund normally invests significantly in securities that the portfolio managers expect will generate income (for example, by paying dividends). The Fund may invest up to 50% of its assets in emerging market securities. The Fund may also achieve its exposure to non-U.S. equity securities through investing in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs). The portfolio managers use a value investing style focusing on companies whose securities the portfolio managers believe are undervalued. The portfolio managers partition the Fund’s selection universe by industry and then identify what they believe to be undervalued securities in each industry to determine potential holdings for the Fund representing a broad range of industry groups. The portfolio managers use quantitative factors to screen the Fund’s selection universe, analyzing factors such as price momentum (i.e., changes in security price relative to changes in overall market prices) and earnings estimate revisions (i.e., changes in analysts’ earnings-per-share estimates), and also review and consider fundamental changes. After narrowing the universe through a combination of qualitative analysis and fundamental research, the portfolio managers select securities for the Fund.
 

 

Principal Risks

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first six risks):
 

 	Market Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.
 

 	Issuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.
 

 	Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.
 

 	Non-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.
 

 	Emerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.
 

 	Smaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.
 

 	Credit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.
 

 	Currency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 	Focused Investment Risk:  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors, industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.
 

 	Liquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.
 

 	Management Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund’s management.
 

 	Turnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.
 

Please see “Summary of Principal Risks” in the Fund’s prospectus for a more detailed description of the Fund’s risks. It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.

 

 

Performance Information

The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund’s average annual total returns with those of a broad-based market index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund’s Institutional Class shares. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear.

Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges (loads). For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund’s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results for the newer class that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund’s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under “Additional Performance Information” in the Fund’s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance. Visit us.allianzgi.com for more current performance information.

After-tax returns are estimated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Institutional Class shares only. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary.
