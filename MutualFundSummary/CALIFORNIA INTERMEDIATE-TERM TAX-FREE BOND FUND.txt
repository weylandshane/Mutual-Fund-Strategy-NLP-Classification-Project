Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor, I or Y Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 52% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The portfolio managers primarily buy investment-grade debt securities and, under normal market conditions, will invest at least 80% of the fund’s net assets in debt securities that have interest payments exempt from federal and California income taxes. Cities, counties and other municipalities in California and U.S. territories, such as Puerto Rico, issue these securities.
The fund’s weighted average maturity will be not less than three years nor more than ten years. However, there is no maturity limit on individual securities. 
Although the fund invests primarily in investment-grade securities, up to 20% of the value of the fund’s net assets may be invested in below investment-grade securities, also known as junk bonds. The fund also may invest in securities which, while not rated, are determined by the portfolio managers to be of comparable credit quality to those rated below investment-grade. 
When determining whether to sell a security, portfolio managers consider, among other things, current and anticipated changes in interest rates, the credit quality of a particular issuer, comparable alternatives, general market conditions and any other factor deemed relevant by the portfolio managers. 
Principal Risks
•
Credit Risk – Debt securities, even investment-grade debt securities, are subject to credit risk. Credit risk is the risk that the inability or perceived inability of the issuer to make interest and principal payments will cause the value of the securities to decrease. As a result, the fund’s share price could also decrease. Changes in the credit rating of a debt security held by the fund could have a similar effect.
•
Below Investment-Grade Securities Risk – Issuers of lower rated, high-yield securities are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes (such as an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates), political changes or adverse developments specific to an issuer. These factors may be more likely to cause an issuer of low quality bonds to default on its obligations.
•
Interest Rate Risk – Investments in debt securities are sensitive to interest rate changes. Generally, the value of debt securities and the funds that hold them decline as interest rates rise. The fund’s interest rate risk is moderate under normal market conditions, but it may fluctuate as the portfolio managers reposition the fund in response to changing market conditions. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund’s performance.
•
California Economic Risk – The fund will be sensitive to events that affect California’s economy. Significant political or economic developments in California will likely impact virtually all municipal securities issued in the state. Because the fund invests principally in California municipal securities, it may have a higher level of risk than funds that invest in a larger universe of securities.
•
Municipal Securities Risk – The fund invests principally in municipal securities, so it will be sensitive to events that affect municipal markets, including legislative or political changes and the financial condition of the issuers of municipal securities. By investing primarily in municipal securities, the fund may have a higher level of risk than funds that invest in a larger universe of securities.
•
Loss of Tax Exemptions Risk – There is no guarantee that all of the fund’s income will be exempt from federal or state income taxes. Income from municipal bonds held by the fund could be declared taxable because of unfavorable changes in tax laws, adverse interpretations by the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, or non-compliant conduct of a bond issuer. The fund may sell securities that lose their tax-exempt statuses at inopportune times, which may cause tax consequences or a decrease in the fund’s value.
•
Liquidity Risk – The fund may also be subject to liquidity risk. During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, to meet redemptions, it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund’s share price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund’s investments.
•
Market Risk – The value of securities owned by the fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Fund Performance 
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. Because the Y Class does not have investment performance for a full calendar year, it is not included. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, including yields, please visit americancentury.com.
Sales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.

Effective December 31, 2017, the fund’s investment advisor selected a different benchmark for comparison purposes. The advisor believes the S&P Intermediate Term California AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index is more reflective of the fund’s strategy. Because the S&P Intermediate Term California AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index total return data is first available as of June 30, 2010, returns for the Bloomberg Barclays 7 Year Municipal Bond Index are also shown to cover the 10 year period.
After-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.

Tax Information
The fund intends to distribute income that is exempt from regular federal and California income taxes, however, fund distributions may be subject to capital gains tax. A portion of the fund’s distributions may be subject to federal and/or California income taxes or to the federal alternative minimum tax.
If you hold your fund shares through a tax-deferred investment plan, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, any distributions received from the fund may be taxable as ordinary income upon withdrawal from the tax-deferred plan, regardless of whether the distributions were tax-exempt when earned.
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services for investments in all classes except the Y Class. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
