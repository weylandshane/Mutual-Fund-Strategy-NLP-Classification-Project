Example. The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in Institutional Class, I-2 or Class A shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, and then redeem all your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Investors may pay brokerage commissions on their purchases and sales of Institutional Class shares or I-2 shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover


The Fund pays transaction costs when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example tables, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was [ ]% of the average value of its portfolio.


Principal Investment Strategies


The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances at least 80% of its assets in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal and California income tax ("California Municipal Bonds"). California Municipal Bonds generally are issued by or on behalf of the State of California and its political subdivisions, financing authorities and their agencies. The Fund may invest in debt securities of an issuer located outside of California whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from regular federal income tax and California income tax. By concentrating its investments in California, the Fund will be subject to California State-Specific Risk.


The Fund does not intend to invest in securities whose interest is subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. The Fund may invest 25% or more of its total assets in debt securities whose interest is, in the opinion of bond counsel for the issuer at the time of issuance, exempt from federal income tax ("Municipal Bonds") that finance education, health care, housing, transportation, utilities and other similar projects, and 25% or more of its total assets in industrial development bonds. The Fund may invest the remainder of its net assets in other types of Fixed Income Instruments. "Fixed Income Instruments" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private-sector entities. The average portfolio duration of this Fund varies based on Pacific Investment Management Company LLC's ("PIMCO") market forecasts and under normal market conditions is not expected to exceed three years. Duration is a measure used to determine the sensitivity of a security's price to changes in interest rates. The longer a security's duration, the more sensitive it will be to changes in interest rates. The total return sought by the Fund consists of both income earned on the Fund's investments and capital appreciation. The portfolio manager focuses on bonds with the potential to offer attractive current income, typically looking for bonds that can provide consistently attractive current yields or that are trading at competitive market prices. Capital appreciation, if any, generally arises from decreases in interest rates or improving credit fundamentals for a particular state, municipality or issuer.


The Fund invests primarily in investment grade debt securities, but may invest up to 10% of its total assets in high yield securities ("junk bonds") that are rated Caa or higher by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's"), or equivalently rated by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services ("S&P") or Fitch, Inc. ("Fitch"), or, if unrated, determined by PIMCO to be of comparable quality.


The Fund may invest in derivative instruments, such as options, futures contracts or swap agreements, or in mortgage- or asset-backed securities.

The Fund may purchase or sell securities on a when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment basis and may engage in short sales. The Fund may also invest in securities issued by entities, such as trusts, whose underlying assets are California Municipal Bonds, including, without limitation, residual interest bonds. The Fund may, without limitation, seek to obtain market exposure to the securities in which it primarily invests by entering into a series of purchase and sale contracts or by using other investment techniques (such as buy backs or dollar rolls). The Fund may also invest up to 10% of its total assets in preferred securities.

Principal Risks


It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are listed below.



Interest Rate Risk: the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration



Call Risk: the risk that an issuer may exercise its right to redeem a fixed income security earlier than expected (a call). Issuers may call outstanding securities prior to their maturity for a number of reasons (e.g., declining interest rates, changes in credit spreads and improvements in the issuer's credit quality). If an issuer calls a security that the Fund has invested in, the Fund may not recoup the full amount of its initial investment and may be forced to reinvest in lower-yielding securities, securities with greater credit risks or securities with other, less favorable features



Credit Risk: the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations



High Yield Risk: the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as "junk bonds") are subject to greater levels of credit, call and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments, and may be more volatile than higher-rated securities of similar maturity



Market Risk: the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries



Issuer Risk: the risk that the value of a security may decline for a reason directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services



Liquidity Risk: the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market, reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities, and may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where investor redemptions from fixed income mutual funds may be higher than normal, causing increased supply in the market due to selling activity



Derivatives Risk: the risk of investing in derivative instruments (such as futures, swaps and structured securities), including leverage, liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or valuation complexity. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the initial amount invested. The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, a reduction in the Fund's returns and/or increased volatility. Over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives are also subject to the risk that a counterparty to the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations to the other party, as many of the protections afforded to centrally-cleared derivative transactions might not be available for OTC derivatives. For derivatives traded on an exchange or through a central counterparty, credit risk resides with the Fund's clearing broker, or the clearinghouse itself, rather than with a counterparty in an OTC derivative transaction. Changes in regulation relating to a mutual fund's use of derivatives and related instruments could potentially limit or impact the Fund's ability to invest in derivatives, limit the Fund's ability to employ certain strategies that use derivatives and/or adversely affect the value of derivatives and the Fund's performance



Equity Risk: the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred securities, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities



Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: the risks of investing in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, including interest rate risk, extension risk, prepayment risk and credit risk



Leveraging Risk: the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, magnifying gains and losses and causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged. This means that leverage entails a heightened risk of loss



Management Risk: the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax restrictions, policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved



Municipal Bond Risk: the risk that a Fund may be affected significantly by the economic, regulatory or political developments affecting the ability of issuers of Municipal Bonds to pay interest or repay principal



California State-Specific Risk: the risk that by concentrating its investments in California Municipal Bonds, the Fund may be affected significantly by economic, regulatory or political developments affecting the ability of California issuers to pay interest or repay principal



Municipal Project-Specific Risk: the risk that the Fund may be more sensitive to adverse economic, business or political developments if it invests a substantial portion of its assets in the bonds of similar projects (such as those relating to education, health care, housing, transportation,

and utilities), industrial development bonds, or in bonds from issuers in a single state


Short Exposure Risk: the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale will not fulfill its contractual obligations, causing a loss to the Fund

An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.


Performance Information


The performance information shows summary performance information for the Fund in a bar chart and an Average Annual Total Returns table. The information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index and an index of similar funds. Absent any applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations, performance would have been lower. The bar chart shows performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares. For periods prior to the inception date of I-2 shares (April 30, 2008), performance information shown in the table for that class is based on the performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by I-2 shares. Performance for Class A shares in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. The Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.


The Bloomberg Barclays California 1 Year Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index comprised of California Municipal Bond Issues having a maturity of at least one year and less than two years. The Lipper California Short/Intermediate Municipal Debt Funds Average is a total return performance average of funds that invest primarily in municipal debt issues that are exempt from taxation in California, with dollar-weighted average maturities of one to five years.

(1) After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Institutional Class shares only. After-tax returns for other classes will vary.
