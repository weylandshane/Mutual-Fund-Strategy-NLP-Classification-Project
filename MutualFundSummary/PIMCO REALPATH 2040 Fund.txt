1 Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses include interest expense of the Underlying PIMCO Funds of [ ]%. Interest expense can result from certain transactions within the Underlying PIMCO Funds and is separate from the management fees paid to PIMCO. Excluding interest expense of the Underlying PIMCO Funds, Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement are [ ]%, [ ]% and [ ]% for Institutional Class, Administrative Class and Class A shares, respectively.

2 Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses do not match the Ratio of Expenses to Average Net Assets Excluding Waivers of the Fund, as set forth in the Financial Highlights table of the Fund's prospectus, because the Ratio of Expenses to Average Net Assets Excluding Waivers reflects the operating expenses of the Fund and does not include Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.

3 Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO") has contractually agreed, through July 31, 2019, to waive, first, the advisory fee and, second, the supervisory and administrative fee it receives from the Fund in an amount equal to the expenses attributable to the Management Fees of Underlying PIMCO Funds indirectly incurred by the Fund in connection with its investments in Underlying PIMCO Funds, to the extent the Fund's Management Fees are greater than or equal to the Management Fees of the Underlying PIMCO Funds. This waiver renews annually for a full year unless terminated by PIMCO upon at least 30 days' notice prior to the end of the contract term.


Example. The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in Institutional Class, Administrative Class or Class A shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, and then redeem all your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund's operating expenses remain the same. Investors may pay brokerage commissions on their purchases and sales of Institutional Class shares of the Fund, which are not reflected in the Example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover


The Fund pays transaction costs when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Example tables, affect the Fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund's portfolio turnover rate was [ ]% of the average value of its portfolio.


Principal Investment Strategies


The PIMCO REALPATH® 2040 Fund (the "Fund") is intended for investors seeking professional management of a comprehensive asset allocation strategy for retirement savings. The Fund is managed for shareholders that plan to retire or begin withdrawing assets around the year 2040, the Fund's target year. This is the "self-elected" year of retirement for the investors in the Fund. The primary difference between the PIMCO REALPATH® Funds is their asset allocation, which varies depending on the number of years left until the "self-elected" year of retirement indicated in the PIMCO REALPATH® Fund's name. The Fund's allocation is intended to meaningfully reduce risk and increasingly focus on preservation of capital as the target retirement date of the Fund nears. An investment in the Fund is not guaranteed, and you may experience losses, including losses near, at, or after the target year indicated in the Fund's name. There is no guarantee that the Fund will provide adequate income at and through your retirement.


In managing the Fund, Pacific Investment Management Company LLC ("PIMCO") uses a four-step approach consisting of 1) developing and re-evaluating a long-term asset allocation "glide path"; 2) performing tactical allocation adjustments around the glide path; 3) developing a series of relative value strategies designed to add value beyond the target allocation; and 4) utilizing hedging techniques to manage risks.


The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing under normal circumstances in a combination of affiliated and unaffiliated funds, which may or may not be registered under the Investment Company Act of

1940 (the "1940 Act"), Fixed Income Instruments of varying maturities, equity securities, forwards and derivatives. "Fixed Income Instruments" include bonds, debt securities and other similar instruments issued by various U.S. and non-U.S. public- or private- sector entities. The Fund will invest in such funds, securities, instruments and other investments to the extent permitted under the 1940 Act, or any exemptive relief therefrom. The Fund may invest in Institutional Class or Class M shares of any funds of the Trust and PIMCO Equity Series, an affiliated open-end investment company, except funds of funds ("Underlying PIMCO Funds"), and may also invest in other affiliated funds, including funds of PIMCO ETF Trust, and unaffiliated funds (collectively, "Acquired Funds"). As used in the investment objective, "real return" equals total return less the estimated cost of inflation, which is typically measured by the change in an official inflation measure, and "real capital" equals capital less the estimated cost of inflation measured by the change in an official inflation measure.

The Fund's long-term asset allocations are based on a "glide path" developed by PIMCO and are based on quantitative and qualitative data relating to various risk metrics, long-term market trends, correlation of asset types and actuarial assumptions of life expectancy and retirement. The Fund's current glide path asset allocation is based on its target date, which is the year in the name of the Fund. The target date assumes a retirement age of 65, and time horizons based on current longevity of persons reaching retirement in average health. Choosing a PIMCO REALPATH® Fund targeting an earlier date represents a more conservative choice; choosing a PIMCO REALPATH® Fund targeting a later date represents a more aggressive choice. The glide path is designed not only to reduce risk as the target retirement date nears, but is also designed to provide investors diversification across a variety of asset classes, with an emphasis on asset classes that can protect against inflation over time. This is achieved by emphasizing allocations to inflation related assets, such as Treasury-Inflation Protected Securities ("TIPS"), commodities, and real estate, which complement exposures from traditional assets, such as U.S. and international equities, U.S. bonds and short-term instruments. The glide path changes over time, generally becoming more conservative as the Fund approaches the target date.


The chart below shows the glide path and illustrates how the allocation among the asset classes changes before and at the target date. The glide path allocation at the target date remains constant beyond that date. As described in greater detail below, PIMCO may adjust the Fund's actual asset allocation exposures from the long-term targets specified by the glide path based on PIMCO's real-time views of perceived risks and opportunities. PIMCO may also choose to modify the target asset allocations of the glide path itself from time to time.


              REALPATH® Glide Path




PIMCO performs tactical allocation adjustments around the glide path, meaning PIMCO may vary the Fund's actual asset allocation exposures from the glide path's long-term targets based on PIMCO's real-time views of perceived risks and opportunities. PIMCO will generally reduce variation from the glide path's targets as the Fund approaches the target year in the Fund's name.


The actual asset allocation at a given time may vary from the target strategic asset allocations based on PIMCO's tactical allocation adjustments and on market movements. These variances will be limited to a certain range relative to the target allocations under normal circumstances. The table below illustrates the permissible range in which the allocations may vary, as measured monthly.

The tactical allocation adjustments described above are driven by PIMCO's secular and cyclical views, which are formulated by considering various qualitative and quantitative factors relating to the U.S. and non-U.S. economies, and securities and commodities markets. These factors include projected growth trends in the U.S. and non-U.S. economies, forecasts for interest rates and the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates (yield curve), current and projected trends in inflation, relative valuation levels in the equity, fixed income, commodity and real estate markets and various segments within those markets, the outlook and projected growth of various industrial sectors, information relating to business cycles, borrowing needs and the cost of capital, political trends, data relating to trade balances, labor information and relevant legislative or public policy changes. These "top down" macro-economic factors, as well as more micro "bottom up" factors that are unique to narrowly defined market sectors, are used to identify attractive relative value strategies. These strategies seek to modestly enhance the Fund's returns in a manner within the allocation ranges relative to the glide path targets described above. When reallocating the Fund's investment exposures, PIMCO may do so by adjusting the mix of affiliated or unaffiliated funds, or by investing directly in securities, instruments and other investments, based on its ongoing analyses of the global economy, financial markets and the relative valuation and risks presented by the aforementioned vehicles and instruments. In selecting and reallocating the mix of affiliated or unaffiliated funds, PIMCO considers a wide range of factors, including a fund's objective, strategies, risks, performance, fees, and other metrics. In seeking to limit the amount of acquired fund fees and expenses that may be borne by Fund investors, PIMCO may choose to invest in particular affiliated or unaffiliated funds, so long as such investment decisions are consistent with the Fund's investment objective, glide path and tactical asset allocations. While PIMCO can adjust the Fund's investment exposures daily, including the vehicles or instruments used to gain those exposures, material shifts in investment exposures typically take place over longer periods of time.


As the Fund reaches the target year indicated in the Fund's name, it may be combined with the PIMCO REALPATH® Income Fund, provided that the Board of Trustees determines that the combination would be in the best interests of the Fund and its shareholders. Prior to any combination, which may occur on or after the target year indicated in the Fund's name, the Fund will provide shareholders with advance notice regarding the combination. If and when such a combination occurs, shareholders of the Fund will become shareholders of the PIMCO REALPATH® Income Fund.


As part of its investment process, PIMCO will also seek to reduce exposure to certain risks by implementing various hedging transactions. These hedging transactions seek to reduce a Fund's exposure to certain severe, unanticipated market events that could significantly detract from returns. PIMCO intends to utilize these hedging transactions once the Fund is within 10 years of the target retirement date or at such other times as deemed appropriate by PIMCO.


Once the tactical asset allocation adjustments, relative value strategies and risk hedging strategies have been determined, PIMCO then evaluates various combinations of affiliated or unaffiliated funds, securities, instruments and other investments to obtain the desired exposures and invests accordingly. Additional information for these Underlying PIMCO Funds can be found in the Statement of Additional Information and/or the Underlying PIMCO Funds' prospectuses and financial reports. Additional Underlying PIMCO Funds may be added or deleted in the future without shareholder notification.


Principal Risks


It is possible to lose money on an investment in the Fund. The principal risks of investing in the Fund include risks from direct investments and/or indirect exposure through investment in Acquired Funds. The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return are listed below.



The following risks are principal risks of investing in the Fund.



New/Small Fund Risk: the risk that a new or smaller Fund's performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, new Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies



Allocation Risk: the risk that a Fund could lose money as a result of less than optimal or poor asset allocation decisions. The Fund could miss attractive investment opportunities by underweighting markets that subsequently experience significant returns and could lose value by overweighting markets that subsequently experience significant declines



Acquired Fund Risk: the risk that a Fund's performance is closely related to the risks associated with the securities and other investments held by the Acquired Funds and that the ability of a Fund to achieve its investment objective will depend upon the ability of the Acquired Funds to achieve their investment objectives



The following risks are principal risks of investing in the Fund that include risks from direct investments and/or indirect exposure through investment in Acquired Funds.



New/Small Fund Risk: the risk that a new or smaller Fund's performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long term. In addition, new Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies



Interest Rate Risk: the risk that fixed income securities will decline in value because of an increase in interest rates; a fund with a longer average portfolio duration will be more sensitive to changes in interest rates than a fund with a shorter average portfolio duration



Call Risk: the risk that an issuer may exercise its right to redeem a fixed income security earlier than expected (a call). Issuers may call outstanding securities prior to their maturity for a number of reasons (e.g., declining

interest rates, changes in credit spreads and improvements in the issuer's credit quality). If an issuer calls a security that the Fund has invested in, the Fund may not recoup the full amount of its initial investment and may be forced to reinvest in lower-yielding securities, securities with greater credit risks or securities with other, less favorable features


Credit Risk: the risk that the Fund could lose money if the issuer or guarantor of a fixed income security, or the counterparty to a derivative contract, is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations



High Yield Risk: the risk that high yield securities and unrated securities of similar credit quality (commonly known as "junk bonds") are subject to greater levels of credit, call and liquidity risks. High yield securities are considered primarily speculative with respect to the issuer's continuing ability to make principal and interest payments, and may be more volatile than higher-rated securities of similar maturity



Market Risk: the risk that the value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting securities markets generally or particular industries



Issuer Risk: the risk that the value of a security may decline for a reason directly related to the issuer, such as management performance, financial leverage and reduced demand for the issuer's goods or services



Liquidity Risk: the risk that a particular investment may be difficult to purchase or sell and that the Fund may be unable to sell illiquid securities at an advantageous time or price or achieve its desired level of exposure to a certain sector. Liquidity risk may result from the lack of an active market, reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities, and may be magnified in a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where investor redemptions from fixed income mutual funds may be higher than normal, causing increased supply in the market due to selling activity



Derivatives Risk: the risk of investing in derivative instruments (such as futures, swaps and structured securities), including leverage, liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and management risks, mispricing or valuation complexity. Changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with, and may be more sensitive to market events than, the underlying asset, rate or index, and the Fund could lose more than the initial amount invested. The Fund's use of derivatives may result in losses to the Fund, a reduction in the Fund's returns and/or increased volatility. Over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives are also subject to the risk that a counterparty to the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations to the other party, as many of the protections afforded to centrally-cleared derivative transactions might not be available for OTC derivatives. For derivatives traded on an exchange or through a central counterparty, credit risk resides with the Fund's clearing broker, or the clearinghouse itself, rather than with a counterparty in an OTC derivative transaction. Changes in regulation relating to a mutual fund's use of derivatives and related instruments could potentially limit or impact the Fund's ability to invest in derivatives, limit the Fund's ability to employ certain strategies that use derivatives and/or adversely affect the value of derivatives and the Fund's performance



Commodity Risk: the risk that investing in commodity-linked derivative instruments may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments



Equity Risk: the risk that the value of equity securities, such as common stocks and preferred securities, may decline due to general market conditions which are not specifically related to a particular company or to factors affecting a particular industry or industries. Equity securities generally have greater price volatility than fixed income securities



Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: the risks of investing in mortgage-related and other asset-backed securities, including interest rate risk, extension risk, prepayment risk and credit risk



Foreign (Non-U.S.) Investment Risk: the risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than a fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, increased risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates of portfolio securities, and the risk of unfavorable foreign government actions, including nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockage, or political changes or diplomatic developments. Foreign securities may also be less liquid and more difficult to value than securities of U.S. issuers



Real Estate Risk: the risk that the Fund's investments in Real Estate Investment Trusts ("REITs") or real estate-linked derivative instruments will subject the Fund to risks similar to those associated with direct ownership of real estate, including losses from casualty or condemnation, and changes in local and general economic conditions, supply and demand, interest rates, zoning laws, regulatory limitations on rents, property taxes and operating expenses. The Fund's investments in REITs or real estate-linked derivative instruments subject it to management and tax risks. In addition, privately traded REITs subject the Fund to liquidity and valuation risk



Emerging Markets Risk: the risk of investing in emerging market securities, primarily increased foreign (non-U.S.) investment risk



Sovereign Debt Risk: the risk that investments in fixed income instruments issued by sovereign entities may decline in value as a result of default or other adverse credit event resulting from an issuer's inability or unwillingness to make principal or interest payments in a timely fashion



Currency Risk: the risk that foreign (non-U.S.) currencies will change in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the Fund's investments in foreign (non-U.S.) currencies or in securities that trade in, and receive revenues in, or in derivatives that provide exposure to, foreign (non-U.S.) currencies



Leveraging Risk: the risk that certain transactions of the Fund, such as reverse repurchase agreements, loans of portfolio securities, and the use of when-issued, delayed delivery or forward commitment transactions, or derivative instruments, may give rise to leverage, magnifying gains and losses and causing the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not been leveraged. This means that leverage entails a heightened risk of loss



Smaller Company Risk: the risk that the value of securities issued by a smaller company may go up or down, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably

PIMCO REALPATH® 2040 Fund




as compared to more widely held securities, due to narrow markets and limited resources of smaller companies. A Fund's investments in smaller companies subject it to greater levels of credit, market and issuer risk


Management Risk: the risk that the investment techniques and risk analyses applied by PIMCO will not produce the desired results and that legislative, regulatory, or tax restrictions, policies or developments may affect the investment techniques available to PIMCO and the individual portfolio manager in connection with managing the Fund. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved



Short Exposure Risk: the risk of entering into short sales, including the potential loss of more money than the actual cost of the investment, and the risk that the third party to the short sale will not fulfill its contractual obligations, causing a loss to the Fund



Tax Risk: the risk that the tax treatment of swap agreements and other derivative instruments, such as commodity-linked derivative instruments, including commodity index-linked notes, swap agreements, commodity options, futures, and options on futures, may be affected by future regulatory or legislative changes that could affect whether income from such investments is "qualifying income" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, or otherwise affect the character, timing and/or amount of the Fund's taxable income or gains and distributions



Subsidiary Risk: the risk that, by investing in certain Underlying PIMCO Funds that invest in a subsidiary (each a "Subsidiary"), the Fund is indirectly exposed to the risks associated with a Subsidiary's investments. The Subsidiaries are not registered under the 1940 Act and may not be subject to all the investor protections of the 1940 Act. There is no guarantee that the investment objective of a Subsidiary will be achieved



Exchange-Traded Fund Risk: the risk that an exchange-traded fund may not track the performance of the index it is designed to track, market prices of shares of an exchange-traded fund may fluctuate rapidly and materially, or shares of an exchange-traded fund may trade significantly above or below net asset value, any of which may cause losses to the Fund invested in the exchange-traded fund



Please see "Description of Principal Risks" in the Fund's prospectus for a more detailed description of the risks of investing in the Fund. An investment in the Fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.


Performance Information


The performance information shows summary performance information for the Fund in a bar chart and an Average Annual Total Returns table. The information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund's average annual returns compare with the returns of a broad-based securities market index and an index of similar funds. Absent any applicable fee waivers and/or expense limitations, performance would have been lower. The bar chart shows performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares. For periods prior to the inception date of Administrative Class shares (June 30, 2008), performance information shown in the table for those shares are based on the performance of the Fund's Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual expenses paid by Administrative Class shares. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. The Fund's past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily an indication of how the Fund will perform in the future.


The Fund's broad-based securities market index is the S&P Target Date 2040 Index. The S&P Target Date 2040 Index seeks to represent a broadly derived consensus for asset allocations that target a particular investment horizon, with asset class exposures driven by a survey of available target date funds for that horizon. These asset class exposures include U.S. large cap, U.S. mid cap, U.S. small cap, international equities, emerging markets, U.S. and international real estate investment trusts, core fixed income, short term treasuries, TIPS, high yield corporate bonds and commodities and are represented by exchange-traded funds in the Index calculation. The Lipper Mixed-Asset Target 2040 Funds Average is a total performance average of funds tracked by Lipper, Inc. that seek to maximize assets for retirement or other purposes with an expected time horizon from January 1, 2036 to December 31, 2040.

(1) After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown, and the after-tax returns shown are not relevant to investors who hold their Fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Institutional Class shares only. After-tax returns for other classes will vary.


Investment Adviser/Portfolio Manager


  PIMCO serves as the investment adviser for the Fund. The Fund's portfolio is managed by Mihir Worah, Rahul Devgon and Graham A. Rennison. Mr. Worah is CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation and a Managing Director of PIMCO, and Messrs. Devgon and Rennison are Senior Vice Presidents of PIMCO. Messrs.
