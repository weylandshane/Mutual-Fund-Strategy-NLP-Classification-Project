EXAMPLE:
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 16% of the average value of its portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund pursues its investment objective by normally emphasizing investments in common stocks. The Fund will normally invest up to 75% of its assets in equity securities selected primarily for their growth potential and at least 25% of its assets in securities the portfolio managers believe have income potential.
With respect to the selection of equity securities selected for growth potential, the portfolio managers additionally consider income-generating potential. Eligible equity securities in which the Fund may invest include:
•	domestic and foreign common stocks
•	preferred stocks
•	securities convertible into common stocks or preferred stocks, such as convertible preferred stocks, bonds, and debentures
•	other securities with equity characteristics
With respect to the selection of securities selected for income potential, equity securities may make up part or all of the income component if they currently pay dividends or the portfolio managers believe they have potential for increasing or commencing dividend payments. The Fund invests to a lesser extent in fixed-income securities, such as corporate bonds.
The portfolio managers apply a “bottom up” approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Fund’s investment policies.
The Fund may also invest in foreign securities, which may include investments in emerging markets.
The Fund may invest its assets in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices, as substitutes for securities in which the Fund invests. The types of derivatives in which the Fund may invest include put and call options. The Fund may invest in derivative instruments (by taking long and/or short positions) for different purposes, including hedging (to offset risks associated with an investment, currency exposure, or market conditions) and to earn income and enhance returns.
The Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS
The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices. The Fund’s investment strategies could result in significant fluctuations of income.
Market Risk.  The value of the Fund’s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers’ belief about a company’s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund’s portfolio could
30 	Janus Henderson Growth and Income Fund
 

also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.
Growth Securities Risk.  The Fund invests in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be “growth” companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers’ perception of a company’s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Fund’s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, “growth” stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.
Fixed-Income Securities Risk.  The Fund may hold debt and other fixed-income securities to generate income. Typically, the values of fixed-income securities change inversely with prevailing interest rates. Therefore, a fundamental risk of fixed-income securities is interest rate risk, which is the risk that the value of such securities will generally decline as prevailing interest rates rise, which may cause the Fund’s net asset value to likewise decrease. For example, while securities with longer maturities and durations tend to produce higher yields, they also tend to be more sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates and are therefore more volatile than shorter-term securities and are subject to greater market fluctuations as a result of changes in interest rates. Further, during periods of very low or negative interest rates, the Fund may not be able to maintain positive returns. The Fund may be subject to heightened interest rate risk because the Federal Reserve has ended its monetary stimulus program known as quantitative easing and interest rates are near historically low levels. The Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate several times in recent periods and has signaled additional increases in the near future. To the extent the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates, there is a risk that the fixed-income markets will experience increased volatility and that the liquidity of certain Fund investments may be reduced. These developments could cause the Fund’s net asset value to fluctuate or make it more difficult for the Fund to accurately value its securities. These developments or others also could cause the Fund to face increased shareholder redemptions, which may lead to increased portfolio turnover and transaction costs, or could force the Fund to liquidate investments at disadvantageous times or prices, therefore adversely affecting the Fund as well as the value of your investment. The amount of assets deemed illiquid remaining within the Fund may also increase, making it more difficult to meet shareholder redemptions and further adversely affecting the value of the Fund. How specific fixed-income securities may react to changes in interest rates will depend on the specific characteristics of each security. Fixed-income securities are also subject to credit risk, prepayment risk, valuation risk, extension risk, and liquidity risk. Credit risk is the risk that the credit strength of an issuer of a fixed-income security will weaken and/or that the issuer will be unable to make timely principal and interest payments and that the security may go into default. Prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates, certain fixed-income securities with higher interest rates, such as mortgage- and asset-backed securities, may be prepaid by their issuers thereby reducing the amount of interest payments. Valuation risk is the risk that one or more of the fixed-income securities in which the Fund invests are priced differently than the value realized upon such security’s sale. In times of market instability, valuation may be more difficult. Extension risk is the risk that borrowers may pay off their debt obligations more slowly in times of rising interest rates, which will lengthen the duration of the portfolio. Liquidity risk is the risk that fixed-income securities may be difficult or impossible to sell at the time that the portfolio managers would like or at the price the portfolio managers believe the security is currently worth.
Foreign Exposure Risk.  The Fund may have exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund’s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.
Derivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative’s original cost,
31 	Janus Henderson Growth and Income Fund
 

and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The Fund may use derivatives for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.
Securities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.
Management Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund’s performance has varied over time. Class T Shares (formerly named Class J Shares, the initial share class) of the Fund commenced operations with the Fund’s inception. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, and Class R Shares of the Fund commenced operations on July 6, 2009. Class N Shares of the Fund commenced operations on August 4, 2017.
•	The performance shown for Class T Shares is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, and Class R Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of each respective share class, without the effect of any fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class I Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class J Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class N Shares for periods prior to August 4, 2017, reflects the performance of the Fund’s Class T Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
If Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, and Class R Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to July 6, 2009, or Class N Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to August 4, 2017, the performance shown for each respective share class may have been different. The performance shown for periods following the Fund’s commencement of Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, Class N Shares, and Class R Shares reflects the fees and expenses of each respective share class, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated. The bar chart figures do not include any applicable sales charges that an investor may pay when they buy or sell Class A Shares or Class C Shares of the Fund. If sales charges were included, the returns would be lower. The table compares the Fund’s average annual returns for the periods indicated to a broad-based securities market index. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Fund’s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.
The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at janushenderson.com/performance or by calling 1-877-335-2687.

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
If you purchase Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, Class R Shares, or Class T Shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.
