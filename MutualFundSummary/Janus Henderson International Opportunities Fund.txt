INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
Janus Henderson International Opportunities Fund seeks long-term capital appreciation primarily through investment in equities of non-U.S. companies.
FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND
This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold Shares of the Fund. Each share class has different expenses, but represents an investment in the same Fund. For Class A Shares, you may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the Fund or in other Janus Henderson mutual funds. More information about these and other discounts, as well as eligibility requirements for each share class, is available from your financial professional and in the “Purchases” section on page 142 of the Fund’s Prospectus and in the “Purchases” section on page 84 of the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information. In addition, please see Appendix A – Intermediary Sales Charge Waivers and Discounts. You may also incur brokerage commissions charged by your broker or financial intermediary when buying Class N Shares of the Fund that are not reflected in the table or in the example below.

(2)	Janus Capital has contractually agreed to waive its investment advisory fee and/or reimburse operating expenses to the extent that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses (excluding the fees payable pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 plan, shareholder servicing fees, such as transfer agency fees (including out-of-pocket costs), administrative services fees and any networking/omnibus/administrative fees payable by any share class, brokerage commissions, interest, dividends, taxes, acquired fund fees and expenses, and extraordinary expenses) exceed 0.94% until February 1, 2019. In addition, until February 1, 2019, Janus Capital has agreed to reduce the administrative services fee payable by the Fund’s Class R Shares pursuant to the Fund’s Transfer Agency Agreement so that such fees do not exceed 0.21% of Class R Shares’ average daily net assets. The contractual fee waiver may be terminated or modified prior to this date only at the discretion of the Fund’s Board of Trustees.
EXAMPLE:
The following Example is based on expenses without waivers. The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your

investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses without waivers remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. The portfolio turnover rate of Henderson International Opportunities Fund (the “Predecessor Fund”) and the Fund for the fiscal year August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017 was 51% of the average value of the portfolio. The portfolio turnover rate of the Fund for the fiscal period August 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 was 5% of the average value of the portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 40% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of non-U.S. companies and in at least three different countries. Equity securities include common stocks and related securities, such as preferred stock, convertible securities, and depositary receipts. Non-U.S. companies include companies in emerging market countries and are broadly defined to include any company that meets one of the following tests: (i) its country of organization, its primary business office and/or the principal trading market of its stock are located outside of the U.S., (ii) 50% or more of its assets are located in a country other than the U.S., or (iii) 50% or more of its revenues are derived from outside of the U.S.
Fund investment performance will be derived primarily from stock selection. A strategic asset allocation process will be a secondary contributor to the investment process. Security selection may be based upon an analysis of a company’s valuations relative to earnings forecasts or other valuation criteria, earnings growth prospects of a company, the quality of a company’s management and the unique competitive advantages of a company. Asset allocation will be reviewed regularly based upon strategic views related to the growth prospects, valuations and pricing associated with international equity regions. Assets of the Fund are allocated to teams of portfolio managers who have experience with respect to a particular geographic region or discipline.
The Fund generally sells a stock when, in the portfolio managers’ opinions, there is a deterioration in the company’s fundamentals, the company fails to meet performance expectations, the stock achieves its target price, its earnings are disappointing or its revenue growth has slowed. The Fund may also sell a stock if the portfolio managers believe that negative country or regional factors may affect the company’s outlook, in the portfolio managers’ opinion, a superior investment opportunity arises or to meet cash requirements. The portfolio managers anticipate that the Fund will continue to hold securities of companies that grow or expand so long as the portfolio managers believe the securities continue to offer prospects of long-term growth. Some of the Fund’s investments may produce income, although income from dividends and interest will be incidental and not an important consideration in choosing investments.
77 	Janus Henderson International Opportunities Fund
 

The Fund may, under unusual circumstances, invest in a single country or a limited number of countries. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities issued by smaller companies and in less seasoned issuers, including through initial public offerings and private placements.
The Fund may invest its assets in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, commodities, or currencies, as substitutes for securities in which the Fund invests. In particular, the Fund may invest in derivatives such as forward currency contracts to offset risks associated with currency exposure.
The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading to achieve its investment objective. The Fund does not limit its investments to companies of any particular size and may invest a significant portion of its assets in smaller and less seasoned issuers. However, in an attempt to reduce portfolio risks, the portfolio managers generally will invest across countries, industry groups and/or sectors.
The Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS
The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking a global equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.
Foreign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities and derivatives that provide exposure to foreign markets, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund’s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.
Emerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund’s investments. In addition, the Fund’s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country’s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund’s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also involve other risks. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 17.7% of the Fund’s investments were in emerging markets (i.e. countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).
Sector Risk.  At times, the Fund may have a significant portion of its assets invested in securities of companies conducting business within an economic sector. Companies in the same economic sector may be similarly affected by economic or market events, making the Fund more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that economic sector than funds that invest
78 	Janus Henderson International Opportunities Fund
 

more broadly. As the Fund’s portfolio becomes more concentrated, the Fund is less able to spread risk and potentially reduce the risk of loss and volatility.
Geographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Fund invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Fund than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility.
Market Risk.  The value of the Fund’s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers’ belief about a company’s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund’s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.
Small- and Mid-Sized Companies Risk.  The Fund’s investments in securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies, which can include smaller, start-up companies offering emerging products or services, may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. For example, while small- and mid-sized companies may realize more substantial growth than larger or more established issuers, they may also suffer more significant losses as a result of their narrow product lines, limited operating history, greater exposure to competitive threats, limited financial resources, limited trading markets, and the potential lack of management depth. Securities issued by small- and mid-sized companies tend to be more volatile and somewhat more speculative than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies. These holdings are also subject to wider price fluctuations and tend to be less liquid than stocks of larger or more established companies, which could have a significant adverse effect on the Fund’s returns, especially as market conditions change.
Initial Public Offering Risk.  The Fund’s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (“IPO”) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Fund’s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Fund will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Fund increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund’s performance will generally decrease.
Derivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative’s original cost, and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. The Fund may use derivatives, including forward currency contracts, for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.
Portfolio Turnover Risk.  Increased portfolio turnover may result in higher costs, which may have a negative effect on the Fund’s performance. In addition, higher portfolio turnover may result in the acceleration of capital gains and the recognition of greater levels of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary federal income tax rates when distributed to shareholders.
Securities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.
Management Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.

The Fund’s primary benchmark index is the MSCI EAFE® Index. The index is described below.
•	The MSCI EAFE® (Europe, Australasia, Far East) Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index designed to measure developed market equity performance. The MSCI EAFE® Index is composed of companies representative of the market structure of developed market countries.
Prior to June 5, 2017, the Predecessor Fund used the MSCI EAFE® Index gross of foreign withholding taxes. Effective June 5, 2017, the Fund’s performance will be compared to the MSCI EAFE® Index net of foreign withholding taxes because it more closely reflects the Fund’s investment universe and is consistent with the practices of other funds advised by Janus Capital.
After-tax returns are calculated using distributions for the Predecessor Fund’s Class A Shares for the period prior to June 5, 2017. If Class A Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to June 5, 2017, the distributions used to calculate the after-tax returns may have been different. After-tax returns are calculated using the historically highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your individual tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. The after-tax return information shown above does not apply to Fund shares held through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA.
After-tax returns are only shown for Class A Shares of the Fund. After-tax returns for the other classes of Shares will vary from those shown for Class A Shares due to varying sales charges (as applicable), fees, and expenses among the classes.

TAX INFORMATION
The Fund’s distributions are taxable, and will be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account (in which case you may be taxed upon withdrawal of your investment from such account).

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
If you purchase Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, Class R Shares, or Class T Shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment or to recommend one share class over another. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
