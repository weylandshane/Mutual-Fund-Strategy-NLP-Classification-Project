Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you  invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods (unless otherwise indicated), that you earn a 5% return each year. The example also assumes that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same, except that it reflects the rate and duration of any fee waivers noted in the table above. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor, I or Y Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 31% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies
Under normal market conditions, the fund invests at least 80% of its net assets in inflation-linked debt securities. These securities include inflation-linked U.S. Treasury securities, inflation-linked securities issued by U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury, and inflation-linked securities issued by other entities such as domestic and foreign corporations and governments. Inflation-linked securities are designed to protect the future purchasing power of the money invested in them.
The fund may invest in securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury and certain U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities such as the Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Ginnie Mae is supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Securities issued or guaranteed by other U.S. government agencies or instrumentalities, such as the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) are not guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury or supported by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. However, they are authorized to borrow from the U.S. Treasury to meet their obligations.
The fund also may invest a portion of its net assets in fixed-income securities that are not linked to inflation. These securities may include other debt securities, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities, whether issued by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities, corporations or other non-governmental issuers.
The fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in securities denominated in foreign currencies and may invest beyond this limit in U.S. dollar denominated securities of foreign issuers. The fund invests primarily in investment-grade securities, but may also invest a portion of its assets in high-yield securities, or junk bonds.
The fund also may invest in derivative instruments such as options, futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and swap agreements (including, but not limited to, credit default swap agreements), or in mortgage- or asset-backed securities, provided that such instruments are in keeping with the fund’s investment objective.
The weighted average duration of the fund’s portfolio must be five years or shorter. Duration is an indication of the relative sensitivity of a security’s market value to changes in interest rates. The longer the weighted average duration of the fund’s portfolio, the more sensitive its market value is to interest rate fluctuations. Duration is different from maturity in that it attempts to measure the interest rate sensitivity of a security, as opposed to its expected final maturity.
To determine whether to buy or sell a security, the portfolio managers consider, among other things, various fund requirements and standards, along with economic conditions, alternative investments and interest rates.
Principal Risks
•
Interest Rate Risk – Inflation-linked securities trade at prevailing real interest rates. Generally, when real interest rates rise, the value of the fund’s debt securities will decline. The opposite is true when real interest rates decline. The real interest rate is the current market interest rate minus the market’s inflation expectations. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund’s performance.
•
Credit Risk – The inability or perceived inability of a security’s issuer to make interest and principal payments may cause the value of the security to decrease. As a result the fund’s share price could also decrease. Changes in the credit rating of a debt security held by the fund could have a similar effect.

3


•
High-Yield Risk – Issuers of high-yield securities are more vulnerable to real or perceived economic changes (such as an economic downturn or a prolonged period of rising interest rates), political changes or adverse developments specific to an issuer. These factors may be more likely to cause an issuer of low quality bonds to default on its obligations.
•
Liquidity Risk – During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, to meet redemptions it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund’s share price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund’s investments.
•
Prepayment Risk – The fund may invest in debt securities backed by mortgages or other assets. If these underlying assets are prepaid, the fund may benefit less from declining interest rates than funds of similar duration that invest less heavily in mortgage- and asset-backed securities.
•
Derivatives Risk – The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional instruments. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit and correlation risk.
•
Foreign Securities Risk – Foreign securities have certain unique risks, such as currency risk, social, political and economic risk, and foreign market and trading risk. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.
•
Market Risk – The value of securities owned by the fund may go up and down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably.
•
Redemption Risk – The fund may need to sell securities at times it would not otherwise do so to meet shareholder redemption requests. Selling securities to meet such redemptions may cause the fund to experience a loss, increase the fund’s transaction costs or have tax consequences. To the extent that a large shareholder (including a fund of funds or 529 college savings plan) invests in the fund, the fund may experience relatively large redemptions as such shareholder reallocates its assets.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.
Fund Performance
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. Because the G Class does not have investment performance for a full calendar year, it is not included. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, including yields, please visit americancentury.com.
Sales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.

Prior to August 31, 2011, this class had a front-end sales charge of 4.50%. The front-end sales charge is now 2.25%. Performance prior to that date has been restated to reflect this change in the sales charge.
The after-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.
