FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND
This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold Shares of the Fund. Each share class has different expenses, but represents an investment in the same Fund. For Class A Shares, you may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the Fund or in other Janus Henderson mutual funds. More information about these and other discounts, as well as eligibility requirements for each share class, is available from your financial professional and in the “Purchases” section on page 142 of the Fund’s Prospectus and in the “Purchases” section on page 84 of the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information. In addition, please see Appendix A – Intermediary Sales Charge Waivers and Discounts. You may also incur brokerage commissions charged by your broker or financial intermediary when buying Class N Shares of the Fund that are not reflected in the table or in the example below.

(1)	Other Expenses have been restated to reflect the estimated expenses that the Fund expects to incur.
(2)	Janus Capital has contractually agreed to waive its investment advisory fee and/or reimburse operating expenses to the extent that the Fund’s total annual fund operating expenses (excluding the fees payable pursuant to a Rule 12b-1 plan, shareholder servicing fees, such as transfer agency fees (including out-of-pocket costs), administrative services fees and any networking/omnibus/administrative fees payable by any share class; brokerage commissions; interest; dividends; taxes; acquired fund fees and expenses; and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.03% until at least February 1, 2019. The contractual waiver may be terminated or modified prior to this date only at the discretion of the Board of Trustees.
EXAMPLE:
The following Example is based on expenses without waivers. The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses without waivers remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. The portfolio turnover rate of Henderson Emerging Markets Fund (the “Predecessor Fund”) and the Fund for the fiscal year August 1, 2016 to July 31, 2017 was 32% of the average value of the portfolio. The portfolio turnover rate of the Fund for the fiscal period August 1, 2017 to September 30, 2017 was 2% of the average value of the portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in equity securities of companies in emerging market countries. Equity securities include common stocks and related securities, such as preferred stock, convertible securities and depositary receipts. Emerging market countries are all countries represented by the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm and/or those countries considered to be developing by the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation or the United Nations. These countries typically are located in the Asia-Pacific region, Eastern Europe, Central and South America, and Africa.
Emerging market companies are broadly defined to include any company that meets one or more of the following tests: (i) its country of organization, its primary business office and/or the principal trading market of its stock are located in an emerging market country, (ii) 50% or more of its assets are located in emerging market countries, or (iii) 50% or more of its revenues are derived from emerging market countries.
In addition to the Fund’s main investments, the Fund may invest no more than 20% of its net assets in the securities of issuers in developed market countries.
Fund investment performance will be derived primarily from stock selection. Security selection will be based upon an analysis of certain valuation criteria, the quality of a company’s management and the unique competitive advantages of a company.
The Fund generally sells a stock when, in the portfolio managers’ opinion, there is a deterioration in the company’s fundamentals, the company fails to meet performance expectations, the stock achieves its target price, its earnings are disappointing or its revenue growth has slowed. The Fund may also sell a stock if the portfolio managers believe that negative country or regional factors may affect the company’s outlook, in the portfolio managers’ opinion, a superior investment opportunity arises or to meet cash requirements. The portfolio managers anticipate that the Fund will continue to hold securities of companies that grow or expand so long as the portfolio managers believe the securities continue to offer prospects of long-term growth. Some of the Fund’s investments may produce income, although income from dividends and interest will be incidental and not an important consideration in choosing investments. The Fund may engage in active and frequent trading to achieve its investment objective.
The Fund may, under unusual circumstances, invest in a single country or a limited number of countries. In addition, the Fund may invest in securities issued by smaller companies and in less seasoned issuers.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS
The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.
Foreign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in non-U.S. securities, particularly investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund’s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.
Emerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund’s investments. In addition, the Fund’s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore changes in the value of a country’s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund’s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance. Additionally, foreign and emerging market risks, including but not limited to price controls, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, nationalization, and restrictions on repatriation of assets may be heightened to the extent the Fund invests in Chinese local market securities. Some of the risks of investing directly in non-U.S. and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in non-U.S. securities through various other investment vehicles.
Market Risk.  The value of the Fund’s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers’ belief about a company’s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund’s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.
Portfolio Turnover Risk.  Increased portfolio turnover may result in higher costs, which may have a negative effect on the Fund’s performance. In addition, higher portfolio turnover may result in the acceleration of capital gains and the recognition of greater levels of short-term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary U.S. federal income tax rates when distributed to shareholders.
Small-Sized Companies Risk.  The Fund’s investments in securities issued by small-sized companies, which can include smaller, start-up companies offering emerging products or services, may involve greater risks than are customarily associated with larger, more established companies. Securities issued by small-sized companies tend to be more volatile and somewhat more speculative than securities issued by larger or more established companies and may underperform as compared to the securities of larger or more established companies.
Growth Securities Risk.  The Fund may invest in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be “growth” companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers’ perception of a company’s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Fund’s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of
11 	Janus Henderson Emerging Markets Fund
 

favor depending on market and economic conditions, “growth” stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.
Geographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Fund invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Fund than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility.
Management Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund’s performance has varied over time. Returns shown prior to June 5, 2017 are those of the Predecessor Fund, Henderson Emerging Markets Fund. The Predecessor Fund was advised by Henderson Global Investors (North America) Inc. and subadvised by Henderson Investment Management Limited. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class I Shares and Class R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund were reorganized into Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class I Shares and Class N Shares, respectively, of the Fund on June 2, 2017. Class A Shares, Class C Shares and Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund commenced operations with the Predecessor Fund’s inception on December 31, 2010. Class R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund commenced operations on November 30, 2015. Class S Shares and Class T Shares of the Fund commenced operations on June 5, 2017.
•	The performance shown for Class A Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class A Shares of the Predecessor Fund and is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class A Shares of the Predecessor Fund, in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class C Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class C Shares of the Predecessor Fund and is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class C Shares of the Predecessor Fund, in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class I Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund and is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund, in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class N Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund and is calculated using the fees and expenses of R6 Shares of the Predecessor Fund, in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers, except that for periods prior to November 30, 2015, performance shown for Class N Shares reflects the performance of Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund, calculated using the estimated fees and expenses of Class N Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class S Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund, calculated using the estimated fees and expenses of Class S Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class T Shares prior to June 5, 2017 reflects the performance of Class I Shares of the Predecessor Fund, calculated using the estimated fees and expenses of Class T Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
Returns of the Fund will be different from the Predecessor Fund as they have different expenses.
The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated. The bar chart figures do not include any applicable sales charges that an investor may pay when they buy or sell Class A Shares or Class C Shares of the Fund. If sales charges were included, the returns would be lower. The table compares the Fund’s average annual returns for the periods indicated to a broad-based securities market index. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Fund’s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.

(1)	Calculated assuming maximum permitted sales loads.
(2)	The one year return is calculated to include the contingent deferred sales charge.
The Fund’s primary benchmark index is the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm. The index is described below.
•	The MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm is a free float-adjusted market capitalization index that is designed to measure equity market performance of emerging markets.
Prior to June 5, 2017, the Predecessor Fund used the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm gross of foreign withholding taxes. Effective June 5, 2017, the Fund’s performance will be compared to the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm net of foreign withholding taxes because it more closely reflects the Fund’s investment universe and is consistent with the practices of other funds advised by Janus Capital.
After-tax returns are calculated using distributions for the Predecessor Fund’s Class I Shares for the period prior to June 5, 2017. If Class I Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to June 5, 2017, the distributions used to calculate the after-tax returns may have been different. After-tax returns are calculated using the historically highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your individual tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. The after-tax return information shown above does not apply to Fund shares held through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA.
After-tax returns are only shown for Class I Shares of the Fund. After-tax returns for the other classes of Shares will vary from those shown for Class I Shares due to varying sales charges (as applicable), fees, and expenses among the classes.

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
If you purchase Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, or Class T Shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services.
