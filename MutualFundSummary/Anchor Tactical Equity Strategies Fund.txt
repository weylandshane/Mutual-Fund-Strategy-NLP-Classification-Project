Annual Fund Operating Expenses

(expenses that you pay each year
as a percentage of the value of your investment)

 	 
Management Fees	1.60%	1.60%
Distribution and Service (12b-1) Fees	0.50%	0.25%
Other Expenses	0.34%	0.34%
Interest and dividend expense on securities sold short	0.09%	0.09%
Remaining Other Expenses	0.25%	0.25%
Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses(1)	0.13%	0.13%
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses	2.57%	2.32%
(1)	Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses are the indirect costs of investing in other investment companies. The operating expenses in this fee table will not correlate to the expense ratio in the Fund’s financial highlights because the financial statements include only the direct operating expenses incurred by the Fund, not the indirect costs of investment companies.
 

Example: This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds.

 

The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based upon these assumptions your costs would be:

 

 	1 Year	3 Years	5 Years	10 Years
Investor Class	$260	$799	$1,365	$2,905
Institutional Class	$235	$724	$1,240	$2,656
 

Portfolio Turnover: The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 1,091%.

 

Principal Investment Strategies: The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective, utilizing a “fund of funds” structure, by allocating assets among various strategies based on the adviser’s research and analysis regarding market trends. A market trend is the movement of a financial market in a particular direction over time. Under normal market conditions, the Fund invests, directly or indirectly through unaffiliated exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and mutual funds (together with ETFs, “Underlying Funds”), at least 80% of its net assets (plus the amount of borrowings, if any) in long and short positions in equity securities. The Fund takes a long position, or purchases shares of a security, when the adviser believes a security will increase in value, and a short position, or sells shares of borrowed stock, when the adviser believes the value of a security will decrease. The Fund takes long and short positions in securities that are highly correlated to major US equity indices based on long, intermediate, and short term trends. The adviser considers a long term trend to be those that are observed over two years or more; intermediate trends nine to 24 months; and short term trends up to nine months.

At least 80% of the Fund’s assets will be invested in:

(1)	U.S. or foreign equity securities of any market capitalization including Underlying Funds that primarily invest in or are otherwise exposed to domestic and foreign equity securities; and
(2)	derivative instruments, including options, futures, and total return swaps, designed to replicate some or all of the features of an underlying portfolio of equity securities.
 

The Fund may also invest in U.S. or foreign cash equivalents including money market funds and treasuries.

 

The adviser seeks to achieve the Fund’s secondary objective by hedging the Fund’s investment portfolio when it believes security prices will decline. The adviser will hedge by:

(I)	increasing allocations to cash equivalents or U.S. Treasury securities;
(II)	purchasing inverse mutual funds or inverse ETFs; and
(III)	selling short ETFs or securities the adviser believes have demonstrated a high correlation to the broader equity indices.
 

The Fund may invest in inverse funds linked to equity securities or indices when the adviser believes this strategy will provide an effective hedge for the Fund’s equity investments.

 

Generally, the adviser does not attempt to evaluate individual securities. The adviser uses technical analysis, including monitoring price movements and price trends, of equity markets in an effort to achieve the Fund’s objective through proper allocation of the Fund’s portfolio securities. The adviser’s decision to buy or sell a Fund holding will be made based on adviser developed trend and risk models that evaluate current market conditions, and this analysis will guide the adviser’s determination of the appropriate exposure level to the equity market. The adviser buys and sells securities and derivatives to increase or decrease the Fund’s exposure to the equity market. The Fund’s adviser may engage in active and frequent trading of the Fund’s portfolio securities and derivatives to achieve the Fund’s investment objective.

 

Principal Investment Risks: As with all mutual funds, there is the risk that you could lose money through your investment in the Fund.

 

The following describes the risks the Fund bears directly or indirectly through investments in Underlying Funds. As with any mutual fund, there is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve its goal.

 

Counterparty Risk: A counterparty (the other party to a transaction or an agreement or the party with whom the Fund executes transactions) to a transaction with the Fund may be unable or unwilling to make timely principal, interest or settlement payments, or otherwise honor its obligations.

 

Derivatives Risk: The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. These risks include (i) the risk that the counterparty to a derivative transaction may not fulfill its contractual obligations; (ii) risk of mispricing or improper valuation; and (iii) the risk that changes in the value of the derivative may not correlate perfectly with the underlying asset, rate or index. Derivative prices are highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially during a short period of time. Such prices are influenced by numerous factors that affect the markets, including, but not limited to: changing supply and demand relationships; government programs and policies; national and international political and economic events, changes in interest rates, inflation and deflation and changes in supply and demand relationships. Trading derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities.

 

Exchange-Traded Funds Risk: The ETFs in which the Fund invests will not be able to replicate exactly the performance of the indices they track and may result in a loss. When the Fund invests in another investment company, including an ETF, it will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any fees and expenses payable directly by the other investment company. Therefore, the Fund will incur higher expenses, many of which may be duplicative. In addition, the Fund may be affected by losses of the Underlying Funds and the level of risk arising from the investment practices of the Underlying Funds (such as the use of leverage by the funds). The Fund has no control over the investments and related risks taken by the Underlying Funds in which it invests. Investments in ETFs are also subject to the following risks: (i) the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade above or below their net asset value; (ii) an active trading market for an ETF’s shares may not develop or be maintained; or (iii) trading of an ETF’s shares may be halted for a number of reasons.

 

Foreign Investment Risk: The risk that investing in foreign (non-U.S.) securities either directly or indirectly may result in the Fund experiencing more rapid and extreme changes in value than the Fund that invests exclusively in securities of U.S. companies, due to smaller markets, differing reporting, accounting and auditing standards, nationalization, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, currency blockages and political changes or diplomatic developments. The costs of investing in many foreign markets are higher than the U.S. and investments may be less liquid.

 

Fund of Funds Risk: The ability of the Fund to meet its investment objective is directly related to the ability of the ETFs in which it invests and their respective investment managers, to meet their investment objectives. Certain investment managers may be dependent

7 
 
upon a single individual or small group of individuals, the loss of which could adversely affect their success. There can be no assurance that any underlying investment vehicle will achieve its investment objectives.

Hedging Risk: Although intended to limit or reduce investment risk, hedging strategies may also limit or reduce the potential for profit. There is no assurance that hedging strategies will be successful.

 

Inverse ETF Risk: Inverse ETFs seek to provide investment results that will match a certain percentage of the inverse of the performance of a specific benchmark on a daily basis. Because they reset daily there may be significant volatility associated with inverse ETFs. The inverse ETFs in which the Fund invests may not be able to replicate exactly the inverse of the performance of the indices they track. Inverse ETFs fall in price when stock prices are rising. Additionally, inverse ETFs may employ leverage which magnifies the changes in the underlying stock index upon which they are based. Investments in inverse ETFs will prevent the Fund from participating in market-wide or sector-wide gains and may not prove to be an effective hedge. During periods of increased volatility, inverse ETFs may not perform in the manner they are designed.

 

Inverse Funds Risk: Inverse funds typically lose value as the index or security tracked by the fund increases in value; a result that is the opposite from traditional funds. Because they reset daily there may be significant volatility associated with inverse funds. The inverse funds in which the Fund invests may not be able to replicate exactly the inverse of the performance of the benchmark they track. Inverse funds fall in price when its benchmark prices are rising. Additionally, inverse funds may employ leverage which magnifies the changes in the underlying benchmark upon which they are based. Investments in inverse funds will prevent the Fund from participating in market-wide or sector-wide gains and may not prove to be an effective hedge. During periods of increased volatility, inverse funds may not perform in the manner they are designed.

  

Management Risk: The Adviser may be incorrect in its assessment of the intrinsic value of the securities the Fund holds which may result in a decline in the value of Fund shares and failure to achieve its investment objective. The Fund’s portfolio managers use qualitative analyses and/or models. Any imperfections or limitations in such analyses and models could affect the ability of the portfolio managers to implement strategies.

 

Portfolio Turnover Risk: The Fund’s high portfolio turnover will increase its transaction costs and may result in increased realization of net short-term capital gains (which are taxable to shareholders as ordinary income when distributed to them), higher taxable distributions and lower after-tax performance.

 

Securities Market Risk: The value of securities owned by the Fund may go up or down, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably, due to factors affecting particular companies or the securities markets generally. A general downturn in the securities market may cause multiple asset classes to decline in value simultaneously.

 

Short Sales Risk: Short sales risk is the risk of loss associated with any appreciation on the price of a security borrowed in connection with a short sale. The Fund may engage in short sales that are not made “against-the-box,” which means that the Fund may sell short securities even when they are not actually owned or otherwise covered at all times during the period the short position is open. Short sales that are not made “against-the-box” theoretically involve unlimited loss potential since the market price of securities sold short may continuously increase.

 

Small and Medium Capitalization Companies: The earnings and prospects of small and medium sized companies are more volatile than larger companies and may experience higher failure rates than larger companies. Small and medium sized companies normally have a lower trading volume than larger companies, which may tend to make their market price fall more disproportionately than larger companies in response to selling pressures and may have limited markets, product lines, or financial resources and lack management experience.

 

Performance: The bar chart and performance table below show the variability of the Fund’s returns, which is some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund’s performance from year to year and by showing the Fund’s one-year and since inception performance compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. The bar chart shows performance of the Fund’s Institutional Class shares for each calendar year since the Fund's inception. The performance table compares the performance of the Fund over time to the performance of a broad-based securities market index.

Tax Information: Dividends and capital gain distributions you receive from the Fund, whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Fund shares or receive them in cash, are taxable to you at either ordinary income or capital gains tax rates unless you are investing through a tax-deferred plan such as an IRA or 401(k) plan. However, these dividend and capital gain distributions may be taxable upon their eventual withdrawal from tax-deferred plans.

 

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries: If you purchase the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
