FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. You may be required to pay commissions and/or other forms of compensation to a broker for transactions in Advisor Class shares, which are not reflected in the tables or the examples below.

Shareholder Fees (fees paid directly from your investment)

None

Annual Fund Operating Expenses (expenses that you pay each year as a percentage of the value of your investment)

 

 	 	 	 	 
 	Advisor Class
Management Fees(a)	.39	%
Distribution and/or Service (12b-1) Fees	None	 
Other Expenses:	 	 
Transfer Agent	.11	%
Other Expenses(b)	35.06	%
 	
 
 
Total Other Expenses	35.17	%
 	
 
 
Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses	.04	%
 	
 
 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses Before Waiver	35.60	%
 	
 
 
Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement(c)	(35.16	)%
 	
 
 
Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses After Fee Waiver and/or Expense Reimbursement	.44	%
 	 	 
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 
(a)	The management fee paid to the Adviser consists of a base fee at an annualized rate of 0.55% of the Fund’s average daily net assets and a positive or negative performance adjustment of up to an annualized rate of 0.50% based upon the Fund’s performance relative to the S&P 500 Index, resulting in a minimum total fee of 0.05% and a maximum total fee of 1.05%. The management fee shown above is based on the fee accrued as of December 31, 2017; the actual management fee to be paid by the Fund will depend on the performance of the Fund from its inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018.
(b)	Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, which reflect only those initial offering costs being amortized during the current fiscal year. (Offering costs are amortized for a one-year period following commencement of operations.) If prior fiscal year offering costs had been included, Other Expenses would have been 38.35%.
(c)	The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or to bear expenses of the Fund through April 30, 2019 to the extent necessary to prevent Total Other Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses other than the advisory fees of any AB Mutual Funds in which the Fund may invest, interest expense, taxes, extraordinary expenses, and brokerage commissions and other transaction costs), on an annualized basis, from exceeding 0.05% of average daily net assets (“expense limitation”). Any fees waived and expenses borne by the Adviser may be reimbursed by the Fund until the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal period in which the fee was waived or the expense was borne, provided that no reimbursement payment will be made that would cause the Fund’s Total Other Expenses to exceed the expense limitation. In connection with the Fund’s investments in AB Government Money Market Portfolio (the “Money Market Portfolio”), the Adviser has contractually agreed to waive its management fee from the Fund and/or reimburse other expenses of the Fund in an amount equal to the Fund’s pro rata share of the Money Market Portfolio’s effective management fee, as included in “Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses”.
 Examples

The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also assume that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the Fund’s operating expenses stay the same (except for the exclusion of offering costs after the first year) and that any fee waiver and/or expense limitation is in effect through the date indicated above. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

 	 	 
 		 	Advisor Class	 	 
After 1 Year	 	$	45	 
After 3 Years	 	$	5,094	 
After 5 Years	 	$	7,753	 
After 10 Years	 	$	10,116

Portfolio Turnover

The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These transaction costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples, affect the Fund’s performance. During the fiscal period from Fund inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 53% of the average value of its portfolio.

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

The Fund invests primarily in the equity securities of U.S. companies that the Adviser believes are undervalued. The Adviser believes that, over time, a company’s stock price will come to reflect its intrinsic economic value. The Fund may invest in companies of any size and in any industry.

The Adviser depends heavily upon the fundamental analysis and research of its large internal research staff in making investment decisions for the Fund. The research staff follows a primary research universe of approximately 500, largely U.S., companies. In determining a company’s intrinsic economic value, the Adviser takes into account many fundamental and financial factors that it believes bear on the company’s ability to perform in the future, including earnings growth, prospective cash flows, dividend growth and growth in book value. The Adviser then ranks each of the companies in its research universe in the relative order of disparity between their intrinsic economic values and their current stock prices, with companies with the greatest disparities receiving the highest rankings (i.e., being considered the most undervalued). The Adviser anticipates that the Fund’s portfolio normally will include companies ranking in the top three deciles of the Adviser’s valuation model.

The Adviser recognizes that the perception of what is a “value” stock is relative and the factors considered in determining whether a stock is a “value” stock may, and often will, have differing relative significance in different phases of an economic cycle. Also, at different times, and as a result of how individual companies are valued in the market, the Fund may be attracted to investments in companies with different market capitalizations (i.e., large-, mid- or small-capitalization) or companies engaged in particular types of business (e.g., banks and other financial institutions), although the Fund does not intend to concentrate in any particular industries or businesses. The Fund’s portfolio emphasis upon particular industries or sectors will be a by-product of the stock selection process rather than the result of assigned targets or ranges.

The Fund may enter into derivatives transactions, such as options, futures contracts, forwards, and swaps. The Fund may use options strategies involving the purchase and/or writing of various combinations of call and/or put options, including on individual securities and stock indices, futures contracts (including futures contracts on individual securities and stock indices) or shares of exchange-traded funds. These transactions may be used, for example, in an effort to earn extra income, to adjust exposure to individual securities or markets, or to protect all or a portion of the Fund’s portfolio from a decline in value, sometimes within certain ranges.

 

 

PRINCIPAL RISKS

•	Market Risk: The value of the Fund’s investments will fluctuate as the stock or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or other events that affect large portions of the market. It includes the risk that a particular style of investing, such as the Fund’s value approach, may be underperforming the market generally.
•	Capitalization Risk: Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies. Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies may have additional risks because these companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources.
•	Derivatives Risk: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the Fund, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than more traditional investments.
•	Management Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the intended results.
As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Fund.

(a)	The management fee paid to the Adviser consists of a base fee at an annualized rate of 0.55% of the Fund’s average daily net assets and a positive or negative performance adjustment of up to an annualized rate of 0.50% based upon the Fund’s performance relative to the MSCI EAFE Index (net), resulting in a minimum total fee of 0.05% and a maximum total fee of 1.05%. The management fee shown above is based on the fee accrued as of December 31, 2017; the actual management fee to be paid by the Fund will depend on the performance of the Fund from its inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2018.
(b)	Other Expenses have been restated to reflect current fees, which reflect only those initial offering costs being amortized during the current fiscal year. (Offering costs are amortized for a one-year period following commencement of operations.) If prior fiscal year offering costs had been included, Other Expenses would have been 13.98%.
(c)	The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or to bear expenses of the Fund through April 30, 2019 to the extent necessary to prevent Total Other Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses other than the advisory fees of any AB Mutual Funds in which the Fund may invest, interest expense, taxes, extraordinary expenses, and brokerage commissions and other transaction costs), on an annualized basis, from exceeding 0.10% of average daily net assets (“expense limitation”). Any fees waived and expenses borne by the Adviser may be reimbursed by the Fund until the end of the third fiscal year after the fiscal period in which the fee was waived or the expense was borne, provided that no reimbursement payment will be made that would cause the Fund’s Total Other Expenses to exceed the expense limitation.

Portfolio Turnover

The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These transaction costs, which are not reflected in the Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples, affect the Fund’s performance. During the fiscal period from Fund inception on June 28, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 29% of the average value of its portfolio.

PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

The Adviser seeks to achieve the Fund’s investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, primarily in common stocks of non-U.S. companies, and in companies in at least three countries other than the United States.

The Fund will invest in companies that are determined by the Adviser to offer favorable long-term sustainable profitability, price stability, and attractive valuations. The Adviser will employ an integrated approach that combines both fundamental and quantitative research to identify attractive investment opportunities. Factors that the Adviser will consider in this regard will include: a company’s record and projections of profitability, accuracy and availability of information with respect to the company, success and experience of management, competitive advantage, low stock price volatility, and liquidity of the company’s securities. The Adviser will compare these results to the characteristics of the general stock markets to determine the relative attractiveness of each company at a given time. The Adviser will weigh economic, political and market factors in making investment decisions. The Adviser will seek to manage the Fund so that it is subject to less share price volatility than many other international mutual funds, although there can be no guarantee that the Adviser will be successful in this regard.

The Fund will primarily invest in mid- and large-capitalization companies, which are currently defined for the Fund as companies that have market capitalizations of $1.5 billion or more. The Fund’s holdings of non-U.S. companies will generally include some companies located in emerging markets.

Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can have a dramatic impact on the returns of equity securities. The Adviser may adjust the foreign currency exposure resulting from the Fund’s security positions through the use of currency-related derivatives, primarily in an effort to minimize the currency risk to which the Fund is subject. However, the Adviser is not required to use such derivatives.

PRINCIPAL RISKS

•	Market Risk: The value of the Fund’s assets will fluctuate as the stock or bond markets fluctuate. The value of the Fund’s investments may decline, sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or other events that affect large portions of the market.
•	Foreign (Non-U.S.) Risk: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic, political, regulatory or other factors. These risks may be heightened with respect to investments in emerging market countries, where there may be an increased amount of economic, political and social instability.
•	Currency Risk: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the Fund’s investments or reduce its returns.
•	Capitalization Risk: Investments in mid-capitalization companies may be more volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies. Investments in mid-capitalization companies may have additional risks because these companies have limited product lines, markets or financial resources.
•	Derivatives Risk: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the Fund, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than more traditional investments.
•	Management Risk: The Fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the Fund, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the intended results.
As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Fund.
