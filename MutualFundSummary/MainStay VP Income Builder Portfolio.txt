MainStay VP Income Builder Portfolio

Investment Objective
The Portfolio seeks current income consistent with reasonable opportunity for future growth of capital and income.

Fees and Expenses of the Portfolio
The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Portfolio. The table does not include any separate account or policy fees or charges imposed under the variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies for which the Portfolio is an investment option. If they were included, your costs would be higher. Investors should consult the applicable variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy prospectus for more information.

Example
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example does not include any separate account or policy fees or charges imposed under the variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies for which the Portfolio is an investment option. If they were included, your costs would be higher. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated whether or not you redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects the contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement arrangement, if applicable, for the current duration of the arrangement only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Portfolio operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 26% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The Portfolio normally invests a minimum of 30% of its net assets in equity securities and a minimum of 30% of its net assets in debt securities. From time to time, the Portfolio may temporarily invest slightly less than 30% of its net assets in equity or debt securities as a result of market conditions, individual securities transactions or cash flow considerations.

Asset Allocation Investment Process: Asset allocation decisions are made by a Committee chaired by MacKay Shields LLC ("MacKay Shields") in collaboration with New York Life Investment Management LLC (“New York Life Investments”). Asset allocation decisions are determined based on the relative values of each asset class, inclusive of the ability of each asset class to generate income. MacKay Shields, the Subadvisor for the fixed-income portion of the Portfolio, may use equity index and fixed-income futures to manage the Portfolio’s effective exposure, for example, by adding exposure to the equity markets or adjusting fixed-income duration exposure. Neither equity index futures nor fixed-income futures are counted toward the Portfolio's equity or fixed-income allocation guidelines.

Equity Investment Process: Epoch Investment Partners, Inc. ("Epoch"), the Subadvisor for the equity portion of the Portfolio, invests primarily in companies that generate increasing levels of free cash flow and have managements that allocate it effectively to create shareholder value.

The security selection process focuses on free-cash-flow analytics as opposed to traditional accounting-based metrics. Epoch seeks to identify companies with a consistent, straightforward ability to both generate free cash flow and to intelligently allocate it among internal reinvestment opportunities, acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and/or debt reductions.

72

MainStay VP Income Builder Portfolio

Epoch seeks to find and invest in companies that meet its definition of quality-companies that are free cash flow positive or are becoming free cash flow positive and that are led by strong management. The relevant factor in Epoch’s decision on how to deploy free cash flow is the cost of capital and the prospective returns on capital.

Fixed-Income Investment Process: The Portfolio may invest in investment grade and below investment grade debt securities of varying maturities. In pursuing the Portfolio's investment objective, the Portfolio may invest up to 30% of its net assets in debt securities that MacKay Shields believes may provide capital appreciation in addition to income and are rated below investment grade by an independent rating agency, such as Standard & Poor's Ratings Services or Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if unrated, deemed to be of comparable creditworthiness by MacKay Shields. For purposes of this limitation, both the percentage and rating are counted at the time of purchase. If independent rating agencies assign different ratings to the same security, the Portfolio will use the higher rating for purposes of determining the security's credit quality. Securities that are rated below investment grade by independent rating agencies are commonly referred to as “high-yield securities” or "junk bonds."

The Portfolio maintains a flexible approach by investing in a broad range of securities, which may be diversified by company, industry and type.

Principal debt investments include U.S. government securities, domestic and foreign debt securities, mortgage-related and asset-backed securities and floating rate loans. The Portfolio may also enter into mortgage dollar roll and to-be-announced ("TBA") securities transactions.

The Portfolio may also invest in convertible securities such as bonds, debentures, corporate notes and preferred stocks or other securities that are convertible into common stock or the cash value of a stock or a basket or index of equity securities.

Investments Across the Portfolio: The Portfolio may invest in derivatives, such as futures, options, forward commitments and swap agreements, to try to enhance returns or reduce the risk of loss by hedging certain of its holdings. The Portfolio also may use fixed-income futures for purposes of managing duration and yield curve exposures. The Portfolio may invest up to 10% of its total assets in swaps, including credit default swaps.

The Subadvisors may sell a security if they no longer believe the security will contribute to meeting the investment objective of the Portfolio. In considering whether to sell a debt security, MacKay Shields may evaluate, among other things, deterioration in the issuer's credit quality. Epoch may sell or reduce a position in a security if, among other things, it sees an interruption to the dividend policy, a deterioration in fundamentals or when the security is deemed less attractive relative to another security on a return/risk basis. Epoch may also sell or reduce a position in a security when it believes its investment objectives have been met or if it sees the investment thesis is failing to materialize.

Principal Risks
You can lose money by investing in the Portfolio. An investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The investments selected by the Portfolio’s Subadvisors may underperform the market or other investments. The Portfolio may receive large purchase or redemption orders which may have adverse effects on performance if the Portfolio were required to sell securities, invest cash or hold a relatively large amount of cash at times when it would not otherwise do so.

The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio are summarized below.

Market Risk: The value of the Portfolio's investments may fluctuate because of changes in the markets in which the Portfolio invests, which could cause the Portfolio to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives and strategies. Changes in these markets may be rapid and unpredictable. From time to time, markets may experience periods of stress for potentially prolonged periods that may result in: (i) increased market volatility; (ii) reduced market liquidity; and (iii) increased redemptions of Portfolio shares. Such conditions may add significantly to the risk of volatility in the net asset value of the Portfolio's shares.

Multi-Manager Risk: The Portfolio’s performance relies on the selection and monitoring of the Subadvisors as well as how the Portfolio’s assets are allocated among those Subadvisors. Performance will also depend on the Subadvisors’ skill in implementing their respective strategy or strategies. The Subadvisors’ investment strategies may not always be complementary to one another and, as a result, the Subadvisors may make decisions that conflict with one another, which may adversely affect the Portfolio’s performance. For example, a Subadvisor may purchase an investment for the Portfolio at the same time that another Subadvisor sells the investment, resulting in higher expenses without accomplishing any net investment result. Alternatively, several Subadvisors could purchase the same investment at the same time, causing the Portfolio to pay higher expenses because they did not aggregate their transactions. The multi-manager approach may also cause the Portfolio to invest a substantial percentage of its assets in certain types of securities, which could expose the Portfolio to greater risks as associated with those types of securities and lead to large beneficial or detrimental effects on the Portfolio’s performance. The Manager may influence a Subadvisor in terms of its management of a portion of the Portfolio’s assets, including hedging practices, investment exposure and risk management.

A Subadvisor may underperform the market generally and may underperform other subadvisors that the Manager could have selected. One or more Subadvisors may have limited or no experience in managing assets of a registered investment company, which is subject to daily inflows and outflows of investor cash and certain legal and tax-related restrictions on its investments and operations.

MacKay Shields may be subject to potential conflicts of interest in allocating the Portfolio’s assets. Therefore, MacKay Shields will carefully analyze its allocation decisions and take all steps it believes to be necessary to minimize these potential conflicts of interest.

Portfolio Management Risk: The investment strategies, practices and risk analysis used by a Subadvisor may not produce the desired results. In addition, the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective, including during a period in which a Subadvisor takes temporary positions in response to unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, or other unusual or abnormal circumstances.

Debt Securities Risk: The risks of investing in debt or fixed-income securities include (without limitation): (i) credit risk, e.g., the issuer or guarantor of a debt security may be unable or unwilling (or be perceived as unable or unwilling) to make timely principal and/or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations; (ii) maturity risk, e.g., a debt security with a longer maturity may fluctuate in value more than one with a shorter maturity; (iii) market risk, e.g., low demand for debt securities may negatively impact their price; (iv) interest rate risk, e.g., when interest rates go up, the value of a debt security generally goes down, and when interest rates go down, the value of a debt security generally goes up (long-term debt securities are generally more susceptible to interest rate risk than short-term debt securities); and (v) call risk, e.g., during a period of falling interest rates, the issuer may redeem a security by repaying it early, which may reduce the Portfolio’s income if the proceeds are reinvested at lower interest rates.

Interest rates in the United States are near historic lows, and the Portfolio currently faces a heightened level of interest rate risk. To the extent the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) continues to raise the federal funds rate, there is a risk that interest rates across the financial system may rise, possibly significantly and/or rapidly. Rising interest rates or lack of market participants may lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the fixed-income or debt markets, making it more difficult for the Portfolio to sell its fixed-income or debt holdings at a time when a Subadvisor might wish to sell. Decreased liquidity in the fixed-income or debt markets also may make it more difficult to value some or all of the Portfolio’s fixed-income or debt holdings.

Not all U.S. government debt securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government—some are backed only by the issuing agency, which must rely on its own resources to repay the debt. The Portfolio's yield will fluctuate with changes in short-term interest rates.

Equity Securities Risk: Investments in common stocks and other equity securities are particularly subject to the risk of changing economic, stock market, industry and company conditions and the risks inherent in the portfolio managers' ability to anticipate such changes that can adversely affect the value of the Portfolio's holdings. Opportunity for greater gain often comes with greater risk of loss.

Value Stock Risk: Value stocks may never reach what the Subadvisor believes is their full value or they may go down in value. In addition, different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, and therefore the Portfolio's performance may be lower or higher than that of funds that invest in other types of equity securities.

Market Capitalization Risk: To the extent the Portfolio invests in securities issued by small-, mid-, or large-cap companies, the Portfolio will be subject to the risks associated with securities issued by companies of the applicable market capitalization.  Securities of small-cap and mid-cap companies may be subject to greater price volatility, significantly lower trading volumes, cyclical, static or moderate growth prospects and greater spreads between their bid and ask prices than securities of larger companies. Smaller capitalization companies frequently rely on narrower product lines and niche markets and may be more vulnerable to adverse business or market developments.  Securities issued by larger companies may have less growth potential and may not be able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies, especially during strong economic periods.  In addition, larger companies may be less capable of responding quickly to competitive challenges and industry changes, including those resulting from improvements in technology, and may suffer sharper price declines as a result of earnings disappointments.  There is a risk that the securities issued by companies of a certain market capitalization may underperform the broader market at any given time.

High-Yield Securities Risk: Investments in high-yield securities or non-investment grade securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") are considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher quality securities. Such securities may, under certain circumstances, be less liquid than higher rated securities. These securities pay investors a premium (a high interest rate or yield) because of the potential illiquidity and increased risk of loss. These securities can also be subject to greater price volatility. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, these securities may experience higher than normal default rates.

Loan Participation Interest Risk: There may not be a readily available market for loan participation interests, which in some cases could result in the Portfolio disposing of such interests at a substantial discount from face value or holding such interests until maturity. In addition, the Portfolio may be exposed to the credit risk of the underlying corporate borrower as well as the lending institution or other participant from whom the Portfolio purchased the loan participation interests.

Floating Rate Loans Risk: The floating rate loans in which the Portfolio invests are usually rated below investment grade, or if unrated, determined by the Subadvisor to be of comparable quality (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") and are generally considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss, including default, than higher quality debt instruments. Moreover, such investments may, under certain circumstances, be particularly susceptible to liquidity and valuation risks. Although certain floating rate loans are collateralized, there is no guarantee that the value of the collateral will be sufficient or available to satisfy the borrower’s obligation. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, floating rate loans may experience higher than normal default rates. In the event of a recession or serious credit event, among other eventualities, the value of the Portfolio's investments in floating rate loans are more likely to decline. The secondary market for floating rate loans is limited and, thus, the Portfolio’s ability to sell or realize the full value of its investment in these loans to reinvest sale proceeds or to meet redemption obligations may be impaired. In addition, floating rate loans generally are subject to extended settlement periods that may be longer than seven days. As a result, the Portfolio may be adversely affected by selling other investments at an unfavorable time and/or under

74

MainStay VP Income Builder Portfolio

unfavorable conditions or engaging in borrowing transactions, such as borrowing against its credit facility, to raise cash to meet redemption obligations or pursue other investment opportunities.

In certain circumstances, floating rate loans may not be deemed to be securities. As a result, the Portfolio may not have the protection of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws. In such cases, the Portfolio generally must rely on the contractual provisions in the loan agreement and common-law fraud protections under applicable state law.

Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: Investments in mortgage-related securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other asset-backed securities generally involve a stream of payments based on the underlying obligations. These payments, which are often part interest and part return of principal, vary based on the rate at which the underlying borrowers repay their loans or other obligations. Asset-backed securities are subject to the risk that borrowers may default on the underlying obligations and that, during periods of falling interest rates, these obligations may be called or prepaid and, during periods of rising interest rates, obligations may be paid more slowly than expected. Impairment of the underlying obligations or collateral, such as by non-payment, will reduce the security's value. Enforcing rights against such collateral in events of default may be difficult or insufficient. The value of these securities may be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the market's perception of issuers, and the creditworthiness of the parties involved. The ability of the Portfolio to successfully utilize these instruments may depend on the ability of the Subadvisor to forecast interest rates and other economic factors correctly. These securities may have a structure that makes their reaction to interest rate changes and other factors difficult to predict, making their value highly volatile.

Mortgage Dollar Roll Transaction Risk: A mortgage dollar roll is a transaction in which the Portfolio sells mortgage-related securities from its portfolio to a counterparty from whom it simultaneously agrees to buy a similar security on a delayed delivery basis. Mortgage dollar roll transactions are subject to certain risks, including the risk that securities returned to the Portfolio at the end of the roll, while substantially similar, may be inferior to what was initially sold to the counterparty.

TBA Securities Risk: In a TBA securities transaction, the Portfolio commits to purchase certain securities for a fixed price at a future date. The principal risks are that the counterparty may not deliver the security as promised and/or that the value of the TBA security may decline prior to when the Portfolio receives the security.

Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in foreign securities may be riskier than investments in U.S. securities. Differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes and securities markets, including less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards of some foreign markets, less liquid trading markets and political and economic developments in foreign countries, may affect the value of the Portfolio's investments in foreign securities. Foreign securities may also subject the Portfolio's investments to changes in currency rates. Changes in the value of foreign currencies may make the return on an investment go up or down, unrelated to the quality or performance of the investment itself. These risks may be greater with respect to securities of companies that conduct their business activities in emerging markets or whose securities are traded principally in emerging markets.

Convertible Securities Risk: Convertible securities may be subordinate to other securities. In part, the total return for a convertible security depends upon the performance of the underlying stock into which it can be converted. Also, issuers of convertible securities are often not as strong financially as those issuing securities with higher credit ratings, are more likely to encounter financial difficulties and typically are more vulnerable to changes in the economy, such as a recession or a sustained period of rising interest rates, which could affect their ability to make interest and principal payments. If an issuer stops making interest and/or principal payments, the Portfolio could lose its entire investment.

Derivatives Risk: Derivatives are investments whose value depends on (or is derived from) the value of an underlying instrument, such as a security, asset, reference rate or index. Derivative strategies may expose the Portfolio to greater risk than if it had invested directly in the underlying instrument and often involve leverage, which may exaggerate a loss, potentially causing the Portfolio to lose more money than it originally invested and would have lost had it invested directly in the underlying instrument. For example, if the Portfolio is the seller of credit protection in a credit default swap, the Portfolio effectively adds leverage to its portfolio and is subject to the credit exposure on the full notional value of the swap. Derivatives may be difficult to sell, unwind or value. Derivatives may also be subject to counterparty risk, which is the risk that the counterparty (the party on the other side of the transaction) on a derivative transaction will be unable to honor its contractual obligations to the Portfolio. Futures may be more volatile than direct investments in the instrument underlying the contract, and may not correlate perfectly to the underlying instrument. Futures and other derivatives also may involve a small initial investment relative to the risk assumed, which could result in losses greater than if they had not been used. Due to fluctuations in the price of the underlying asset, the Portfolio may not be able to profitably exercise an option and may lose its entire investment in an option. Forward commitments entail the risk that the instrument may be worth less when it is issued or received than the price the Portfolio agreed to pay when it made the commitment. The use of foreign currency forwards may result in currency exchange losses due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or an imperfect correlation between portfolio holdings denominated in a particular currency and the forward contracts entered into by the Portfolio. Uncleared swaps are particularly subject to counterparty credit, correlation, valuation, liquidity and leveraging risks. Additionally, applicable regulators have adopted rules imposing certain margin requirements, including minimums on uncleared swaps, which may result in the Portfolio and its counterparties posting higher margin amounts for uncleared swaps. Certain standardized swaps are subject to mandatory central clearing and exchange trading. Central clearing, which interposes a central clearinghouse to each participant’s swap, and exchange trading are intended to reduce counterparty credit risk and increase liquidity but neither makes swap transactions risk-free. Derivatives may also increase the expenses of the Portfolio.

75

Liquidity and Valuation Risk: Securities purchased by the Portfolio may be illiquid at the time of purchase or liquid at the time of purchase and subsequently become illiquid due to, among other things, events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, operational issues, economic conditions, investor perceptions or lack of market participants. The lack of an active trading market may make it difficult to sell or obtain an accurate price for a security. If market conditions or issuer specific developments make it difficult to value securities, the Portfolio may value these securities using more subjective methods, such as fair value pricing. In such cases, the value determined for a security could be different than the value realized upon such security's sale. As a result, an investor could pay more than the market value when buying Portfolio shares or receive less than the market value when selling Portfolio shares. This could affect the proceeds of any redemption or the number of shares an investor receives upon purchase. Liquidity risk may also refer to the risk that the Portfolio may not be able to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period because of unusual market conditions, unusually high volume of redemptions, or other reasons. To meet redemption requests or to raise cash to pursue other investment opportunities, the Portfolio may be forced to sell securities at an unfavorable time and/or under unfavorable conditions, which may adversely affect the Portfolio.

Money Market/Short-Term Securities Risk: To the extent the Portfolio holds cash or invests in money market or short-term securities, the Portfolio may be less likely to achieve its investment objective. In addition, it is possible that the Portfolio's investments in these instruments could lose money.

Past Performance
The following bar chart and table indicate some of the risks of investing in the Portfolio. The bar chart shows you how the Portfolio's calendar year performance has varied over the last ten years. The average annual total returns table shows how the Portfolio’s average annual total returns for the one-, five- and ten-year periods compare to those of certain broad-based securities market indices and to the Blended Benchmark Index, a composite representation prepared by the Manager of the performance of the Portfolio's asset classes weighted according to their respective weightings in the Portfolio's target range. The Blended Benchmark Index is comprised of the MSCI World Index and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index weighted 50%/50%, respectively. Separate variable annuity and variable universal life insurance account and policy fees and charges are not reflected in the bar chart and table. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. The Portfolio has selected the MSCI World Index as its benchmark. The MSCI World Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization weighted Index that is designed to measure the equity market performance of developed markets.

The Portfolio has selected the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index as an additional benchmark. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based benchmark that measures the investment grade, U.S. dollar-denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market, including Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities (agency fixed-rate and hybrid adjustable rate mortgage pass-throughs), asset-backed securities, and commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Portfolio will perform in the future.

How to Purchase and Sell Shares
Shares of the Portfolio are currently offered to certain separate accounts to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation ("NYLIAC") and may also be offered to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by other insurance companies. Shares of the Portfolio are also offered as underlying investments of the MainStay VP Asset Allocation Portfolios ("Asset Allocation Portfolios").

Individual investors do not transact directly with the Portfolio to purchase and redeem shares. Rather, investors select underlying investment options offered by the applicable policy. Please refer to the prospectus for the variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy that offers the Portfolio as an underlying investment option for information on the allocation of premium payments and on transfers among the investment divisions of the separate account.

Tax Information
Because the Portfolio's shareholders are the separate accounts of NYLIAC or other insurance companies through which you purchased your variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy and the Asset Allocation Portfolios, no discussion is included here as to the federal income tax consequences at the shareholder level. For information concerning the federal income tax consequences to variable annuity and variable universal life insurance policy owners, consult the prospectus relating to the appropriate policy.

Compensation to Broker/Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
The Portfolio and/or its related companies may pay NYLIAC or other participating insurance companies, broker/dealers, or other financial intermediaries for the sale of Portfolio shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker/dealer or other financial intermediary or your sales person to recommend a policy that offers this Portfolio over another investment. Ask your individual salesperson or visit your broker/dealer’s or other financial intermediary firm’s website for more information. For additional information about these payments, please see the section entitled "The Fund and its Management" in the Prospectus.
