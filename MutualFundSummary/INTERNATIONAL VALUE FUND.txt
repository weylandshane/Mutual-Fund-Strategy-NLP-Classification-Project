Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 101% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
In selecting stocks for the fund, the portfolio managers will normally invest at least 80% of the value of the fund’s net assets in equity securities and at least 65% of net assets in securities of issuers from a minimum of three countries outside the United States that have characteristics similar to those of the companies that comprise the MSCI EAFE® Value Index. Characteristics the portfolio managers may consider include industry sector and geographic location, among others.
 
The MSCI EAFE Value Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that monitors the performance of value stocks from Europe, Australasia, and the Far East.
 
The managers use quantitative models in a two-step process to construct the portfolio of stocks for the fund. First, the managers rank stocks from most attractive to least attractive based on each stock’s score from a proprietary expected returns model. In the second step, the expected returns model is imported into an optimization process that balances active return and risk versus the MSCI EAFE Value Index. This index is based on rules that identify companies that are undervalued by the market. Generally, companies may be undervalued due to market declines, poor economic conditions, actual or anticipated bad news regarding the issuer or its industry, or because it has been overlooked by the market. The fund’s investment selection process may result in market sectors or industries being over- or underweighted.
The portfolio managers also intend to spread the fund’s holdings across different countries and geographic regions in an effort to manage the risks of an international portfolio. The fund may invest in companies of all market capitalizations, including small-cap companies.
The portfolio managers generally sell a stock when they believe it has become less attractive relative to other opportunities, its risk characteristics outweigh its return opportunity or specific events alter its prospects.
Principal Risks
•
Foreign Risk – Foreign securities are generally riskier than U.S. securities. Political events (such as civil unrest, national elections and imposition of exchange controls), social and economic events (such as labor strikes and rising inflation), and natural disasters occurring in a country where the fund invests could cause the fund’s investments in that country to experience gains or losses. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.
•
Currency Risk – The fund could experience gains or losses solely on changes in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar.
•
Benchmark Correlation – The fund’s performance will be similar to the performance of its benchmark, the MSCI EAFE Value Index. If the fund’s benchmark goes down, it is likely that the fund’s performance will go down.
•
Market Risk – The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities it owns and other factors generally affecting the securities market.
•
Price Volatility – The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.
•
Style Risk – If the market does not consider the individual stocks purchased by the fund to be undervalued, the value of the fund’s shares may not rise as high as other funds and may in fact decline, even if stock prices generally are increasing.
•
Quantitative Risk – Stocks selected by the portfolio managers using quantitative models may perform differently than expected due to the portfolio managers’ judgments regarding the factors used in the models, the weight placed on each factor, changes from the factors’ historical trends, and technical issues with the construction and implementation of the models (including, for example, data problems and/or software or other implementation issues). There is no guarantee that the use of the quantitative model will result in effective investment decisions for the fund. Additionally, the commonality of portfolio holdings across quantitative investment managers may amplify losses.
•
Financial Sector Risk — The fund may invest a significant portion of its assets in the financial sector and, therefore, the performance of the fund could be negatively impacted by events affecting this sector. This sector can be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, government regulation, the rate of defaults on corporate, consumer and government debt and the availability and cost of capital.
•
Small-Cap Stock Risk – Smaller companies may have limited financial resources, product lines, markets and have less publicly available information. These securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than larger companies’ securities, leading to higher transaction costs. Smaller companies also may be more sensitive to changing economic conditions, and investments in smaller foreign companies may experience more price volatility.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

The after-tax returns are shown only for A Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.

Tax Information
Fund distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (in which case you may be taxed upon withdrawal of your investment from such account).
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services for investments in all classes except the R6 Class. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
