* Class A shares bought without an initial sales charge as part of an investment of $1 million or more may be charged a deferred sales charge of 1.00% if redeemed within one year.
**The fund's investment adviser, The Dreyfus Corporation, has contractually agreed, until March 1, 2019, to waive receipt of its fees and/or assume the direct expenses of the fund so that the direct expenses of none of the classes (excluding Rule 12b-1 fees, shareholder services fees, taxes, interest, brokerage commissions, commitment fees on borrowings and extraordinary expenses) exceed 1.90%. On or after March 1, 2019, The Dreyfus Corporation may terminate this expense limitation at any time. Because "acquired fund fees and expenses" are incurred indirectly by the fund, such fees and expenses are not included in the expense limitation.
+Acquired fund fees and expenses are incurred indirectly by the fund as a result of its investments in underlying funds.

Example

The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the fund's operating expenses remain the same. The one-year example and the first year of the three-, five- and ten-years examples are based on net operating expenses, which reflect the expense limitation by The Dreyfus Corporation. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover

The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover rate was 369.32% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategy
The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective — long-term capital appreciation — with lower volatility than, and moderate correlation to, major equity market indices. The fund uses a "manager of managers" approach by selecting one or more experienced equity managers to serve as subadvisers to manage the fund's assets. The fund allocates its assets among subadvisers that use long/short equity investment strategies that are not expected to have returns that are highly correlated to each other or major equity market indices. The fund may hire, terminate or replace subadvisers and modify material terms and conditions of subadvisory arrangements without shareholder approval. Each of the fund's subadvisers acts independently of any other subadviser and uses its own methodology to select portfolio investments.

The fund normally invests in equity securities, typically common stocks, including securities issued by other investment companies, such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The fund may invest in equity securities of companies with any market capitalization. The fund's investments may include securities of U.S. and foreign issuers, including securities of issuers in emerging markets countries and securities denominated in any currency other than the U.S. dollar. The fund may significantly overweight or underweight certain companies, industries or market sectors.

The fund expects to maintain significant short positions in equity securities and equity-related instruments, including through the derivative instruments described below and by selling short shares of ETFs. Although the fund intends to maintain an overall long position in its portfolio investments, in certain circumstances, the fund's short positions may approach or reach the size of the fund's overall long position. A short sale involves the sale of a security that the fund does not own in the expectation of purchasing the same security (or a security exchangeable therefor) at a later date and at a lower price. The fund will incur a loss as a result of a short sale if the price of the security increases between the date of the short sale and the date on which the fund replaces the borrowed security. The fund will realize a gain if the security declines in price between those two dates. The fund's potential loss is limited only by the maximum attainable price of the security less the price at which the security was sold.

The fund may use derivative instruments, such as options, futures and options on futures, contracts for difference, forward contracts, swaps (including total return swaps) and other derivative instruments, as a substitute for investing directly in an underlying asset, as an alternative to selling a security short, to increase returns, to manage foreign currency risk, as part of a hedging strategy or for other purposes related to the management of the fund. There is no limit to the amount of the fund's assets that may be invested in derivative instruments. When the fund enters into derivatives transactions, it may be required to segregate liquid assets or enter into offsetting, in accordance with applicable regulations.

The fund may engage in short term trading in the execution of its investment strategy.

Principal Risks
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit. It is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. It is not a complete investment program. The fund's share price fluctuates, sometimes dramatically, which means you could lose money.

· Risks of stock investing. Stocks generally fluctuate more in value than bonds and may decline significantly over short time periods. There is the chance that stock prices overall will decline because stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising prices and falling prices. The market value of a stock may decline due to general market conditions or because of factors that affect the particular company or the company's industry.

· Market sector risk. The fund may significantly overweight or underweight certain countries, companies, industries or market sectors, which may cause the fund's performance to be more or less sensitive to developments affecting those countries, companies, industries or sectors.

· Short position risk. Short positions in securities may involve substantial risks. If a short position appreciates in value during the period of the fund's investment, there will be a loss to the fund that could be substantial. Short positions in stocks involve more risk than long positions in stocks because the maximum sustainable loss on a stock purchased is limited to the amount paid for the stock plus the transaction costs, whereas there is no maximum attainable price on the shorted stock. As such, theoretically, short positions in securities have unlimited risk.

· Short sale risk. The fund may make short sales, which involves selling a security it does not own in anticipation that the security's price will decline. Short sales expose the fund to the risk that it will be required to buy the security sold short (also known as "covering" the short position) at a time when the security has appreciated in value, thus resulting in a loss to the fund. Short positions in stocks involve more risk than long positions in stocks because the maximum sustainable loss on a stock purchased is limited to the amount paid for the stock plus the transaction costs, whereas there is no maximum attainable price on the shorted stock. As such, theoretically, stocks sold short have unlimited risk. The fund may not always be able to close out a short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price. The fund may not always be able to borrow a security the fund seeks to sell short at a particular time or at an acceptable price. Thus, there is a risk that the fund may be unable to fully implement its investment strategy that involves short selling due to a lack of available stocks or for some other reason.

· Manager of managers risk. Each subadviser makes investment decisions independently and it is possible that the investment styles of the subadvisers may not complement one another. As a result, the fund's exposure to a given stock, industry, sector, market capitalization, geographic area or investment style could unintentionally be more or less than it would have been if the fund had a single adviser or investment strategy.

· Allocation risk. The ability of the fund to achieve its investment goal depends, in part, on the ability of EACM Advisors, LLC, subject to The Dreyfus Corporation's supervision and approval, to allocate effectively the fund's assets among the subadvisers. There can be no assurance that the actual allocations will be effective in achieving the fund's investment goal.

· Conflicts of interest risk. Certain subadvisers may have potential conflicts of interest which could interfere with their management of the fund's assets allocated to them. For example, the subadvisers may manage other investment funds or accounts for other clients that may have investment objectives and strategies that are similar to, or overlap with, those of the fund, but which have different fee structures than those of the fund, creating potential conflicts of interest in investment decisions regarding investments that may be appropriate for the fund and the subadvisers' other clients.

· Market capitalization risk (small-, mid- and large-cap stock risk). To the extent the fund emphasizes small-, mid- or large-cap stocks, it will assume the associated risks. At any given time, any of these market capitalizations may be out of favor with investors. Compared to small- and mid-cap companies, large-cap companies may be less responsive to changes and opportunities affecting their business. To the extent the fund invests in small- and mid-cap companies, it will be subject to additional risks because the operating histories of these companies tend to be more limited, their earnings and revenues less predictable (and some companies may be experiencing significant losses), and their share prices more volatile than those of larger, more established companies. The shares of smaller companies tend to trade less frequently than those of larger, more established companies, which can adversely affect the pricing of these securities and the fund's ability to sell these securities. Smaller companies may have limited product lines, markets or financial resources, or may depend on a limited management group.

· Foreign investment risk. To the extent the fund invests in foreign securities, the fund's performance will be influenced by political, social and economic factors affecting investments in foreign issuers. Special risks associated with investments in foreign issuers include exposure to currency fluctuations, less liquidity, less developed or less efficient trading markets, lack of comprehensive company information, political and economic instability and differing auditing

and legal standards. Investments denominated in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that such currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and affect the value of these investments held by the fund.

· Emerging market risk. The securities of issuers located or doing substantial business in emerging market countries tend to be more volatile and less liquid than the securities of issuers located in countries with more mature economies. Emerging markets generally have less diverse and less mature economic structures and less stable political systems than those of developed countries. Investments in these countries may be subject to political, economic, legal, market and currency risks. The risks may include less protection of property rights and uncertain political and economic policies, the imposition of capital controls and/or foreign investment limitations by a country, nationalization of businesses and the imposition of sanctions by other countries, such as the United States.

· Derivatives risk. A small investment in derivatives could have a potentially large impact on the fund's performance. The use of derivatives involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in the underlying assets, and the fund's use of derivatives may result in losses to the fund. Derivatives in which the fund may invest can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and there is the risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the fund will not correlate with the underlying assets or the fund's other investments in the manner intended. Certain derivatives have the potential for unlimited loss, regardless of the size of the initial investment. Certain types of derivatives, including over-the-counter transactions, involve greater risks than the underlying assets because, in addition to general market risks, they are subject to liquidity risk, credit and counterparty risk (failure of the counterparty to the derivatives transaction to honor its obligation) and pricing risk (risk that the derivative cannot or will not be accurately valued). Future rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may require the fund to alter, perhaps materially, its use of derivatives.

· ETF and other investment company risk. To the extent the fund invests in pooled investment vehicles, such as ETFs and other investment companies, the fund will be affected by the investment policies, practices and performance of such entities in direct proportion to the amount of assets the fund has invested therein. The risks of investing in other investment companies, including ETFs, typically reflect the risks associated with the types of instruments in which the investment companies invest. When the fund invests in an ETF or other investment company, shareholders of the fund will bear indirectly their proportionate share of the expenses of the ETF or other investment company (including management fees) in addition to the expenses of the fund.

· Leverage risk. The use of leverage, such as lending portfolio securities, entering into contracts for difference, swap agreements, futures contracts or forward currency contracts and engaging in forward commitment transactions, may magnify the fund's gains or losses. Short sales involve borrowing securities and then selling them; thus, the fund's short sales positions effectively leverage the fund's assets.

· Liquidity risk. When there is little or no active trading market for specific types of securities, it can become more difficult to sell the securities in a timely manner at or near their perceived value. In such a market, the value of such securities and the fund's share price may fall dramatically. Investments that are illiquid or that trade in lower volumes may be more difficult to value. Investments in foreign securities, particularly those of issuers located in emerging markets, tend to have greater exposure to liquidity risk than domestic securities.

· Non-diversification risk. The fund is non-diversified, which means that the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers. Therefore, the fund's performance may be more vulnerable to changes in the market value of a single issuer or group of issuers and more susceptible to risks associated with a single economic, political or regulatory occurrence than a diversified fund.

· Portfolio turnover risk. The fund may engage in short-term trading, which could produce higher transaction costs and taxable distributions, and lower the fund's after-tax performance.

Performance
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the performance of the fund's Class A shares from year to year. Sales charges, if any, are not reflected in the bar chart, and if those charges were included, returns would have been less than those shown. The table compares the average annual total returns of the fund's shares to those of a broad measure of market performance. The fund's past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future.

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries
If you purchase shares (other than Class Y shares) through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services. To the extent that the intermediary may receive lesser or no payments in connection with the sale of other investments, the payments from the fund and its related companies may create a potential conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your financial representative to recommend the fund over the other investments. This potential conflict of interest may be addressed by policies, procedures or practices adopted by the financial intermediary. As there may be many different policies, procedures or practices adopted by different intermediaries to address the manner in which compensation is earned through the sale of investments or the provision of related services, the compensation rates and other payment arrangements that may apply to a financial intermediary and its representatives may vary by intermediary. Ask your financial representative or visit your financial intermediary's website for more information.
