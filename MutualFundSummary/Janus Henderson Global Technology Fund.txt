INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
Janus Henderson Global Technology Fund seeks long-term growth of capital.
FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE FUND
This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold Shares of the Fund. Each share class has different expenses, but represents an investment in the same Fund. For Class A Shares, you may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in the Fund or in other Janus Henderson mutual funds. More information about these and other discounts, as well as eligibility requirements for each share class, is available from your financial professional and in the “Purchases” section on page 142 of the Fund’s Prospectus and in the “Purchases” section on page 84 of the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information. In addition, please see Appendix A – Intermediary Sales Charge Waivers and Discounts. You may also incur brokerage commissions charged by your broker or financial intermediary when buying Class N Shares of the Fund that are not reflected in the table or in the example below.

EXAMPLE:
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and reinvest all dividends and distributions. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover:  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 30% of the average value of its portfolio.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT STRATEGIES
The Fund pursues its investment objective by investing, under normal circumstances, at least 80% of its net assets (plus any borrowings for investment purposes) in securities of companies that the portfolio managers believe will benefit significantly from advances or improvements in technology. These companies generally fall into two categories:
•	companies that the portfolio managers believe have or will develop products, processes, or services that will provide significant technological advancements or improvements; and
•	companies that the portfolio managers believe rely extensively on technology in connection with their operations or services.
Some of the industries and companies likely to be represented in the Fund’s portfolio include e-commerce (companies doing business through the Internet); computer (hardware and software); communications (voice, data, and wireless); industrials; Internet (software, services, and infrastructure equipment); and media and entertainment.
The Fund implements this policy by investing primarily in equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies selected for their growth potential. The Fund typically invests at least 40% of its net assets in securities of issuers or companies that are economically tied to different countries throughout the world, excluding the United States. The Fund may, under unusual circumstances, invest in a single country. The Fund may have significant exposure to emerging markets. The Fund may also invest in U.S. and foreign debt securities. From time to time, the Fund may invest in shares of companies through initial public offerings.
The portfolio managers apply a “bottom up” approach in choosing investments. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Fund’s investment policies.
The Fund may also take long or short positions in derivatives, which are instruments that have a value derived from, or directly linked to, an underlying asset, such as equity securities, fixed-income securities, commodities, currencies, interest rates, or market indices. For purposes of meeting its 80% investment policy, the Fund may include derivatives that have characteristics similar to the securities in which the Fund may directly invest. The types of derivatives in which the Fund may invest include options, futures, swaps, warrants, and forward currency contracts. The Fund may use derivatives to hedge, to earn income or enhance returns, as a substitute for securities in which the Fund invests, to increase or decrease the Fund’s exposure to a particular market, to adjust the Fund’s currency exposure relative to its benchmark index, to gain access to foreign markets where direct investment may be restricted or unavailable, or to manage the Fund’s risk profile.
The Fund may lend portfolio securities on a short-term or long-term basis, in an amount equal to up to one-third of its total assets as determined at the time of the loan origination.

PRINCIPAL INVESTMENT RISKS
The biggest risk is that the Fund’s returns will vary, and you could lose money. The Fund is designed for long-term investors seeking an equity portfolio, including common stocks. Common stocks tend to be more volatile than many other investment choices.
Foreign Exposure Risk.  The Fund normally has significant exposure to foreign markets as a result of its investments in foreign securities, including investments in emerging markets, which can be more volatile than the U.S. markets. As a result, its returns and net asset value may be affected to a large degree by fluctuations in currency exchange rates or political or economic conditions in a particular country. In some foreign markets, there may not be protection against failure by other parties to complete transactions. It may not be possible for the Fund to repatriate capital, dividends, interest, and other income from a particular country or governmental entity. In addition, a market swing in one or more countries or regions where the Fund has invested a significant amount of its assets may have a greater effect on the Fund’s performance than it would in a more geographically diversified portfolio. To the extent the Fund invests in foreign debt securities, such investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Additionally, investments in securities of foreign governments involve the risk that a foreign government may not be willing or able to pay interest or repay principal when due. The Fund’s investments in emerging market countries may involve risks greater than, or in addition to, the risks of investing in more developed countries.
Emerging Markets Risk.  The risks of foreign investing mentioned above are heightened when investing in emerging markets. Emerging markets securities involve a number of additional risks, which may result from less government supervision and regulation of business and industry practices (including the potential lack of strict finance and accounting controls and standards), stock exchanges, brokers, and listed companies, making these investments potentially more volatile in price and less liquid than investments in developed securities markets, resulting in greater risk to investors. There is a risk in developing countries that a future economic or political crisis could lead to price controls, forced mergers of companies, expropriation or confiscatory taxation, imposition or enforcement of foreign ownership limits, seizure, nationalization, sanctions or imposition of restrictions by various governmental entities on investment and trading, or creation of government monopolies, any of which may have a detrimental effect on the Fund’s investments. In addition, the Fund’s investments may be denominated in foreign currencies and therefore, changes in the value of a country’s currency compared to the U.S. dollar may affect the value of the Fund’s investments. To the extent that the Fund invests a significant portion of its assets in the securities of issuers in or companies of a single country or region, it is more likely to be impacted by events or conditions affecting that country or region, which could have a negative impact on the Fund’s performance. Some of the risks of investing directly in foreign and emerging market securities may be reduced when the Fund invests indirectly in foreign securities through various other investment vehicles including derivatives, which also involve other risks. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 16.7% of the Fund’s investments were in emerging markets (i.e. countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Indexsm).
Market Risk.  The value of the Fund’s portfolio may decrease if the value of an individual company or security, or multiple companies or securities, in the portfolio decreases or if the portfolio managers’ belief about a company’s intrinsic worth is incorrect. Further, regardless of how well individual companies or securities perform, the value of the Fund’s portfolio could also decrease if there are deteriorating economic or market conditions. It is important to understand that the value of your investment may fall, sometimes sharply, in response to changes in the market, and you could lose money. Market risk may affect a single issuer, industry, economic sector, or the market as a whole.
Growth Securities Risk.  The Fund invests in companies that the portfolio managers believe have growth potential. Securities of companies perceived to be “growth” companies may be more volatile than other stocks and may involve special risks. If the portfolio managers’ perception of a company’s growth potential is not realized, the securities purchased may not perform as expected, reducing the Fund’s returns. In addition, because different types of stocks tend to shift in and out of favor depending on market and economic conditions, “growth” stocks may perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of securities.
Industry Risk.  Although the Fund does not concentrate its investments in specific industries or industry sectors, it may invest in companies related in such a way that they react similarly to certain market pressures. As a result, the Fund’s returns may be considerably more volatile than the returns of a fund that does not invest in similarly related companies.
Derivatives Risk.  Derivatives can be highly volatile and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying referenced securities or asset. Gains or losses from a derivative investment can be substantially greater than the derivative’s original cost,
64 	Janus Henderson Global Technology Fund
 

and can therefore involve leverage. Leverage may cause the Fund to be more volatile than if it had not used leverage. Derivatives can be complex instruments and may involve analysis that differs from that required for other investment types used by the Fund. If the value of a derivative does not correlate well with the particular market or other asset class to which the derivative is intended to provide exposure, the derivative may not produce the anticipated result. Derivatives can also reduce the opportunity for gain or result in losses by offsetting positive returns in other investments. Derivatives can be less liquid than other types of investments and entail the risk that the counterparty will default on its payment obligations. If the counterparty to a derivative transaction defaults, the Fund would risk the loss of the net amount of the payments that it contractually is entitled to receive. To the extent the Fund enters into short derivative positions, the Fund may be exposed to risks similar to those associated with short sales, including the risk that the Fund’s losses are theoretically unlimited. The Fund may use derivatives, including forward exchange contracts, for hedging purposes. Hedging with derivatives may increase expenses, and there is no guarantee that a hedging strategy will work. While hedging can reduce or eliminate losses, it can also reduce or eliminate gains or cause losses if the market moves in a manner different from that anticipated by the Fund or if the cost of the derivative outweighs the benefit of the hedge.
Geographic Concentration Risk.  To the extent the Fund invests a substantial amount of its assets in issuers located in a single country or region, the economic, political, regulatory or other developments or conditions within such country or region will generally have a greater effect on the Fund than they would on a more geographically diversified fund, which may result in greater losses and volatility.
Initial Public Offering Risk.  The Fund’s purchase of shares issued in an initial public offering (“IPO”) exposes it to the risks associated with companies that have little operating history as public companies, as well as to the risks inherent in those sectors of the market where these new issuers operate. Although IPO investments may have had a positive impact on the Fund’s performance in the past, there can be no assurance that the Fund will identify favorable IPO investment opportunities in the future. In addition, as the Fund increases in size, the impact of IPOs on the Fund’s performance will generally decrease.
Securities Lending Risk.  The Fund may seek to earn additional income through lending its securities to certain qualified broker-dealers and institutions. There is the risk that when portfolio securities are lent, the securities may not be returned on a timely basis, and the Fund may experience delays and costs in recovering the security or gaining access to the collateral provided to the Fund to collateralize the loan. If the Fund is unable to recover a security on loan, the Fund may use the collateral to purchase replacement securities in the market. There is a risk that the value of the collateral could decrease below the cost of the replacement security by the time the replacement investment is made, resulting in a loss to the Fund.
Management Risk.  The Fund is an actively managed investment portfolio and is therefore subject to the risk that the investment strategies employed for the Fund may fail to produce the intended results. The Fund may underperform its benchmark index or other mutual funds with similar investment objectives.
An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency.
PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The following information provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing how the Fund’s performance has varied over time. Class T Shares (formerly named Class J Shares, the initial share class) of the Fund commenced operations with the Fund’s inception. Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, and Class I Shares of the Fund commenced operations on July 6, 2009. Class N Shares of the Fund commenced operations on January 27, 2017.
•	The performance shown for Class T Shares is calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares in effect during the periods shown, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class A Shares, Class C Shares, and Class S Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of each respective share class, without the effect of any fee and expense limitations or waivers.
•	The performance shown for Class I Shares for periods prior to July 6, 2009, reflects the performance of the Fund’s former Class J Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class J Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
65 	Janus Henderson Global Technology Fund
 

•	The performance shown for Class N Shares for periods prior to January 27, 2017, reflects the performance of the Fund’s Class T Shares, calculated using the fees and expenses of Class T Shares, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
If Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, and Class I Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to July 6, 2009, or Class N Shares of the Fund had been available during periods prior to January 27, 2017, the performance shown for each respective share class may have been different. The performance shown for periods following the Fund’s commencement of Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, and Class N Shares reflects the fees and expenses of each respective share class, net of any applicable fee and expense limitations or waivers.
The bar chart depicts the change in performance from year to year during the periods indicated. The bar chart figures do not include any applicable sales charges that an investor may pay when they buy or sell Class A Shares or Class C Shares of the Fund. If sales charges were included, the returns would be lower. The table compares the Fund’s average annual returns for the periods indicated to broad-based securities market indices. All figures assume reinvestment of dividends and distributions. For certain periods, the Fund’s performance reflects the effect of expense waivers. Without the effect of these expense waivers, the performance shown would have been lower.
The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) does not necessarily indicate how it will perform in the future. Updated performance information is available at janushenderson.com/performance or by calling 1-877-335-2687.

The Fund’s primary benchmark index is the S&P 500® Index. The Fund also compares its performance to the MSCI All Country World Information Technology Index. The indices are described below.
•	The S&P 500® Index is a commonly recognized, market-capitalization weighted index of 500 widely held equity securities, designed to measure broad U.S. equity performance.
•	The MSCI All Country World Information Technology Index is a capitalization weighted index that measures the performance of information technology securities from developed market countries and emerging market countries. The index includes reinvestment of dividends, net of foreign withholding taxes.
After-tax returns are calculated using distributions for the Fund’s Class T Shares (formerly named Class J Shares, the initial share class). After-tax returns are calculated using the historically highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on your individual tax situation and may differ from those shown in the preceding table. The after-tax return information shown above does not apply to Fund shares held through a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA.
After-tax returns are only shown for Class T Shares of the Fund. After-tax returns for the other classes of Shares will vary from those shown for Class T Shares due to varying sales charges (as applicable), fees, and expenses among the classes.

PAYMENTS TO BROKER-DEALERS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
If you purchase Class A Shares, Class C Shares, Class S Shares, Class I Shares, or Class T Shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment or to recommend one share class over another. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
