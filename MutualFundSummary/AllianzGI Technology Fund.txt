Fees and Expenses of the Fund

The tables below describe the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Fund. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $50,000 in Class A shares of eligible funds that are part of the family of mutual funds sponsored by Allianz. More information about these and other discounts is available in the “Classes of Shares” section beginning on page 98 of the Fund’s prospectus or from your financial advisor. In addition, if you purchase shares through a specific intermediary, you may be subject to different sales charges including reductions in or waivers of such charges. More information about these intermediary-specific sales charge variations is available in Appendix A to the Fund’s prospectus (“Intermediary Sales Charge Discounts and Waivers”).

Examples.  The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in shares of the Fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume that you invest $10,000 in the noted class of shares for the time periods indicated, your investment has a 5% return each year, and the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, the Examples show what your costs would be based on these assumptions.

Portfolio Turnover.  The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). The Fund’s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 was [    ]% of the average value of its portfolio. High levels of portfolio turnover may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes for you if your Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses or in the Examples above, can adversely affect the Fund’s investment performance.

 

 

Principal Investment Strategies

The Fund seeks to achieve its objective by normally investing at least 80% of its net assets (plus borrowings made for investment purposes) in common stocks and other equity securities of technology companies and in

Table of Contents
AllianzGI Technology Fund (continued)

 

 	
derivatives and other synthetic instruments that have economic characteristics similar to equity securities of technology companies. Derivatives transactions may have the effect of either magnifying or limiting the Fund’s gains and losses. The Fund normally may invest up to 50% of its assets in non-U.S. securities, including emerging market securities. Under normal market and other conditions, the Fund will invest no more than 25% of its assets in any one country outside of the United States. The Fund intends to invest primarily in companies with market capitalizations greater than $500 million. The Fund is “non-diversified,” which means that it may invest a significant portion of its assets in a relatively small number of issuers, which may increase risk. The portfolio managers define technology companies as those that provide technology products or services or utilize technology to gain competitive advantages. The portfolio managers evaluate fundamental value and growth prospects and focus on companies that they expect will have strong potential for capital appreciation. In addition to common stocks and other equity securities (such as preferred stocks, convertible securities and warrants), the Fund may invest in securities issued in initial public offerings (IPOs) and may utilize foreign currency exchange contracts, options, futures and forward contracts, short sales, swap agreements and other derivative instruments. Although the Fund may invest in derivatives of any kind, it expects to invest in options, swaps and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange contracts. The Fund may write call options on individual securities that it does not hold in its portfolio (i.e., “naked” call options). The Fund ordinarily expects to use derivative instruments in an attempt to enhance the Fund’s investment returns, to hedge against market and other risks or to obtain market exposure. The Fund may enter into credit default, cross-currency, interest rate, total return, variance and other forms of swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to credit, currency and interest rate risk.

 

 

Principal Risks

The principal risks of investing in the Fund, which could adversely affect its net asset value, yield and total return, are (in alphabetical order after the first six risks):
 

 	Market Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors influencing the U.S. or global economies and securities markets or relevant industries or sectors within them.
 

 	Issuer Risk:  The Fund will be affected by factors specific to the issuers of securities and other instruments in which the Fund invests, including actual or perceived changes in the financial condition or business prospects of such issuers.
 

 	Equity Securities Risk:  Equity securities may react more strongly to changes in an issuer’s financial condition or prospects than other securities of the same issuer.
 

 	Focused Investment Risk (Technology-Related Risk):  Focusing on a limited number of issuers, sectors (such as the technology sectors), industries or geographic regions increases risk and volatility.
 

 	Derivatives Risk:  Derivative instruments are complex, have different characteristics than their underlying assets and are subject to additional risks, including leverage, liquidity and valuation.
 

 	Smaller Company Risk:  Securities issued by smaller companies may be more volatile and present increased liquidity risk relative to securities issued by larger companies.
 

 	Credit and Counterparty Risk:  An issuer or counterparty may default on obligations.
 

 	Currency Risk:  The values of non-U.S. securities may fluctuate with currency exchange rates and exposure to non-U.S. currencies may subject the Fund to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar.
 

 	Emerging Markets Risk:  Non-U.S. investment risk may be particularly high to the extent that the Fund invests in emerging market securities. These securities may present market, credit, currency, liquidity, legal, political, technical and other risks different from, or greater than, the risks of investing in developed countries.
 

 	IPO Risk:  Securities purchased in initial public offerings have no trading history, limited issuer information and increased volatility.
 

 	Leveraging Risk:  Instruments and transactions that constitute leverage magnify gains or losses and increase volatility.
 

 	Liquidity Risk:  The lack of an active market for investments may cause delay in disposition or force a sale below fair value.
 

 	Management Risk:  The Fund will be affected by the allocation determinations, investment decisions and techniques of the Fund’s management.
 

 	Non-U.S. Investment Risk:  Non-U.S. securities markets and issuers may be more volatile, smaller, less liquid, less transparent and subject to less oversight, particularly in emerging markets.
 

 	Short Selling Risk:  Short selling enhances leveraging risk and involves counterparty risk and the risk of unlimited loss.
 

 	Turnover Risk:  High levels of portfolio turnover increase transaction costs and taxes and may lower investment performance.

Performance Information

The performance information below provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in its total return from year to year and by comparing the Fund’s average annual total returns with those of a broad-based market index, a sector-specific index and a performance average of similar mutual funds. The bar chart and the information to its right show performance of the Fund’s Class A shares, but do not reflect the impact of sales charges (loads). If they did, returns would be lower than those shown. Other share classes would have different performance due to the different expenses they bear. Performance in the Average Annual Total Returns table reflects the impact of sales charges. For periods prior to the inception date of a share class, performance information shown for such class may be based on the performance of an older class of shares that dates back to the Fund’s inception, as adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the newer class. Similarly, for periods prior to a reorganization of the Fund, in which a predecessor fund was merged into the Fund, the performance information is based on the performance of the predecessor fund, adjusted to reflect fees and expenses paid by the particular share class of the Fund. These adjustments generally result in estimated performance results that are different from the actual results of the predecessor class and/or the predecessor fund, as the case may be, due to differing levels of fees and expenses paid. Details regarding the calculation of the Fund’s class-by-class performance, including a discussion of any performance adjustments, are provided under “Additional Performance Information” in the Fund’s prospectus and SAI. Past performance, before and after taxes, is not necessarily predictive of future performance. Visit us.allianzgi.com for more current performance information.

After-tax returns are estimated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold Fund shares through

tax-advantaged arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. In some cases the return after taxes may exceed the return before taxes due to an assumed tax benefit from any losses on a sale of Fund shares at the end of the measurement period. After-tax returns are for Class A shares only. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary.

Tax Information

The Fund’s distributions are generally taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an individual retirement account.
 

Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries

If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund, its distributor, its investment adviser or their affiliates may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker-dealer or intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s Web site for more information.
