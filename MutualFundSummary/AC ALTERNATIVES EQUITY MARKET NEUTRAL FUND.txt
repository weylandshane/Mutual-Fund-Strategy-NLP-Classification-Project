Example
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, that you earn a 5% return each year, and that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same. You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor, I or Y Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover 
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 289% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies 
The managers use quantitative models to construct the portfolio for the fund. The portfolio managers buy, or take long positions in, equity securities that they have identified as undervalued. They take short positions in equity securities that they have identified as overvalued.  A short position arises when the fund sells a security it does not own but has borrowed in anticipation that the market price of the security will decline. If the market price in fact declines, the fund can replace the borrowed security at a lower price and capture the value represented by the difference between the higher sale price and the lower replacement price. The fund’s investment process is designed to maintain approximately equal dollar amounts invested in long and short positions at all times. By employing this market neutral strategy, the fund seeks to limit market risk (the effects of general market movements on the fund’s performance). A market neutral strategy seeks to limit the fund’s volatility relative to the market. As a result of this strategy, the portfolio’s price movements are not expected to correlate with the market’s price movements. 
In selecting stocks for the fund, the portfolio managers use quantitative management techniques in a two-step process. First, the managers rank stocks, generally publicly traded companies world-wide with a market capitalization greater than $1 billion, from most attractive to least attractive based on an objective set of measures, including valuation, quality, growth, and sentiment. Second, the portfolio managers use a quantitative model to build a portfolio of stocks from the ranking described above that they believe will provide the optimal balance between risk and expected return.
The portfolio managers generally sell a stock when they believe it has become less attractive relative to other opportunities, its risk characteristics outweigh its return opportunity, or specific events alter its prospects. 
Under normal market conditions, the fund will invest at least 80% of its net assets in equity investments.
The fund’s use of short selling as a principal investment strategy creates leverage in an attempt to increase returns.
The fund invests primarily in developed countries (including the United States), but it may also invest a portion of its assets in emerging market countries.
The fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its principal investment strategies. This may cause higher transaction costs and may affect performance. It may also result in the realization and distribution of capital gains.
Principal Risks
•
Management Risk – Although the fund seeks to have approximately equal dollar amounts invested in long and short positions and a neutral exposure to market movements, there is a risk that the portfolio managers will not be able to construct a portfolio of long and short positions that has limited exposure to general market movements.
•
Investment Process Risk – Stocks selected by the portfolio managers using quantitative models may perform differently than expected due to the portfolio managers’ judgments regarding the factors used in the models, the weight placed on each factor, changes from the factors’ historical trends, and technical issues with the construction and implementation of the models (including, for example, data problems and/or software or other implementation issues). There is no guarantee that the use of the quantitative model will result in effective investment decisions for the fund. Additionally, the commonality of portfolio holdings across quantitative investment managers may amplify losses.
•
Failure to Maintain Market Neutrality – Though the fund seeks to limit risks associated with investing in the general equity market, external conditions may impact the fund’s performance. In addition, although the portfolio managers intend to construct a market neutral portfolio, there is a risk that the portfolio managers will not construct a portfolio that limits exposure to general market movements.
•
Style Risk – Because the fund’s portfolio may not always be style-neutral, its performance may be sensitive to the value/growth cycle within the U.S. equity markets. Also, if at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s quantitative style, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other equity funds using different investment styles.
•
Short Sales Risk – If the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security, the fund may suffer a loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price. Any loss will be increased by the amount of compensation, interest or dividends, and transaction costs the fund must pay to a lender of the security.
•
Leverage Risk – The fund’s investment strategy utilizes leverage, which can increase market exposure and subject the fund to greater risk and higher volatility.
•
Foreign Risk  – Foreign securities are generally riskier than U.S. securities. Political events (such as civil unrest, national elections and imposition of exchange controls), social and economic events (such as labor strikes and rising inflation), and natural disasters

occurring in a country where the fund invests could cause the fund’s investments in that country to experience gains or losses. Securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile and harder to value than U.S. securities.
•
Emerging Markets Risk  – Investing in emerging market countries generally is riskier than investing in foreign developed countries. Emerging market countries may have unstable governments, economies that are subject to sudden change, and significant volatility in their financial markets. These countries also may lack the legal, business and social framework to support securities markets.
•
Overweighting Risk – If the fund is overweighted in a stock or sector, any negative development related to that stock or sector will have a greater impact on the fund than other funds that are not overweighted in that stock or sector.
•
Small Cap Stocks – Though the fund invests primarily in larger companies, it may also invest in smaller companies. Investments in smaller companies may be more volatile and subject to greater risk than larger companies. Smaller companies may have limited financial resources, product lines and markets, and their securities may trade less frequently and in more limited volumes than the securities of larger companies, which could lead to higher transaction costs.
•
Market Risk – The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities the fund owns in its long portfolio or in which the fund has taken a short position.
•
Price Volatility – The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.
•
Principal Loss – At any given time, your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency. 
Fund Performance 
The following bar chart and table provide some indication of the risks of investing in the fund. The bar chart shows changes in the fund’s performance from year to year for Investor Class shares. The table shows how the fund’s average annual returns for the periods shown compared with those of a broad measure of market performance. Because the Y Class does not have investment performance
for a full calendar year, it is not included. The fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how the fund will perform in the future. For current performance information, please visit americancentury.com. 
Sales charges and account fees, if applicable, are not reflected in the bar chart. If those charges were included, returns would be less than those shown.

Tax Information 
Fund distributions are generally taxable as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are investing through a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or individual retirement account (in which case you may be taxed upon withdrawal of your investment from such account). 
Payments to Broker-Dealers and Other Financial Intermediaries 
If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services for investments in all classes except the Y Class.
