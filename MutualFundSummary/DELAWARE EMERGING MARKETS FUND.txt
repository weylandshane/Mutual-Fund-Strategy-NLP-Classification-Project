Class C shares redeemed within one year of purchase are subject to a 1.00% contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC).

“Other expenses” account for Class R6 shares not being subject to certain expenses as described further in the section of the Prospectus entitled “Choosing a share class.”

The Fund’s investment manager, Delaware Management Company (Manager), has contractually agreed to waive all or a portion of its investment advisory fees and/or pay/reimburse expenses (excluding any 12b-1 fees, acquired fund fees and expenses, taxes, interest, short sale dividend and interest expenses, brokerage fees, certain insurance costs, and nonroutine expenses or costs, including, but not limited to, those relating to reorganizations, litigation, conducting shareholder meetings, and liquidations) in order to prevent total annual fund operating expenses from exceeding 1.42% of the Fund’s average daily net assets from March 29, 2018 through March 29, 2019 for all share classes other than Class R6, and 1.29% of the Fund’s Class R6 shares’ average daily net assets from March 29, 2018 through March 29, 2019. These waivers and reimbursements may only be terminated by agreement of the Manager and the Fund.

Example

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. In addition, the example shows expenses for Class C shares, assuming those shares were not redeemed at the end of those periods. The example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and reflects the Manager’s expense waivers and reimbursements for the 1-year contractual period and the total operating expenses without waivers for years 2 through 10. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Fund summaries

Portfolio turnover

The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when Fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 11% of the average value of its portfolio.

What are the Fund’s principal investment strategies?

The Fund invests primarily in a broad range of equity securities of companies located in emerging market countries. Emerging market countries include those currently considered to be developing by the World Bank, the United Nations, or the countries’ governments. These countries typically are located in the Asia-Pacific region, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Central America, South America, and Africa. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the Fund’s net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, will be invested in emerging market issuers (80% policy). The Fund’s 80% policy is nonfundamental and may be changed without shareholder approval. Fund shareholders would be given at least 60 days’ notice prior to any such change. The Fund may invest in companies of any size and may invest more than 25% of its total assets in the securities of issuers located in the same country. The Fund will primarily invest in countries included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. Benchmark weightings may result in the Fund investing over 25% in any one country. The Fund may invest significantly in the Asia-Pacific region, which consists of Hong Kong, the People’s Republic of China, Korea, and Taiwan, among other countries. As a result, the Fund’s investments in the region may be particularly susceptible to risks in that region.

Although the Fund invests primarily in companies from countries considered to be emerging, the Fund will also invest in companies that are not in emerging countries: (1) if the Manager believes that the performance of a company or its industry will be influenced by opportunities in the emerging markets; (2) to maintain exposure to industry segments where the Manager believes there are not satisfactory investment opportunities in emerging countries; and (3) if the Manager believes there is the potential for significant benefit to the Fund.

The Manager believes that although market price and intrinsic business value are positively correlated in the long run, short-term divergences can emerge. The Fund seeks to take advantage of these divergences through a fundamental, bottom-up approach. The Fund invests in securities of companies that the Manager believes have sustainable franchises when they are trading at a discount to the Manager’s intrinsic value estimate for that security.

The Manager defines sustainable franchises as those companies with potential to earn excess returns above their cost of capital over the long run. Sustainability analysis involves identification of a company’s source of competitive advantage and the ability of its management to maximize its return potential. The Manager prefers companies with large market opportunities in which to deploy capital, providing opportunities to grow faster than the overall economy.

Intrinsic value assessment is quantitatively determined through a variety of valuation methods including discounted cash flow, replacement cost, private market transaction, and multiples analysis.

What are the principal risks of investing in the Fund?

Investing in any mutual fund involves the risk that you may lose part or all of the money you invest. Over time, the value of your investment in the Fund will increase and decrease according to changes in the value of the securities in the Fund’s portfolio. The Fund’s principal risks include:

Market risk — The risk that all or a majority of the securities in a certain market — such as the stock or bond market — will decline in value because of factors such as adverse political or economic conditions, future expectations, investor confidence, or heavy institutional selling.

Foreign and emerging markets risk — The risk that international investing (particularly in emerging markets) may be adversely affected by political instability; changes in currency exchange rates; inefficient markets and higher transaction costs; the imposition of economic or trade sanctions; or inadequate or different regulatory and accounting standards. The risk associated with international investing will be greater in emerging markets than in more developed foreign markets because, among other things, emerging markets may have less stable political and economic environments. In addition, there often is substantially less publicly available information about issuers and such information tends to be of a lesser quality. Economic markets and structures tend to be less mature and diverse and the securities markets may also be smaller, less liquid, and subject to greater price volatility.

Company size risk — The risk that investments in small- and/or medium-sized companies may be more volatile than those of larger companies because of limited financial resources or dependence on narrow product lines.

Government and regulatory risk — The risk that governments or regulatory authorities may take actions that could adversely affect various sectors of the securities markets and affect fund performance.

Geographic focus risk — The risk that local political and economic conditions could adversely affect the performance of a fund investing a substantial amount of assets in securities of issuers located in a single country or a limited number of countries. Adverse events in any one country within the Asia-Pacific

region may impact the other countries in the region or Asia as a whole. As a result, adverse events in the region will generally have a greater effect on a fund than if the fund were more geographically diversified, which could result in greater volatility in the fund’s net asset value and losses. Markets in the greater China region can experience significant volatility due to social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties.

Liquidity risk — The possibility that securities cannot be readily sold within seven calendar days at approximately the price at which a fund has valued them.

Growth stock risk — Growth stocks (such as those in the information technology sector) reflect projections of future earnings and revenue. These prices may rise or fall dramatically depending on whether those projections are met. These companies’ stock prices may be more volatile, particularly over the short term.

Active management and selection risk — The risk that the securities selected by fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices, or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. The securities and sectors selected may vary from the securities and sectors included in the relevant index.

The Manager is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie Group Limited (MGL). Other than Macquarie Bank Limited (MBL), a subsidiary of MGL and an affiliate of the Manager, none of the entities noted are authorized deposit-taking institutions for the purposes of the Banking Act 1959 (Commonwealth of Australia). The obligations of these entities do not represent deposits or other liabilities of MBL. MBL does not guarantee or otherwise provide assurance in respect of the obligations of these entities, unless noted otherwise. The Fund is governed by US laws and regulations.

How has Delaware Emerging Markets Fund performed?

The bar chart and table below provide some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund by showing changes in the Fund’s performance from year to year and by showing how the Fund’s average annual total returns for the 1-, 5-, and 10-year or lifetime periods compare with those of a broad measure of market performance. The Fund’s past performance (before and after taxes) is not necessarily an indication of how it will perform in the future. The returns reflect any expense caps in effect during these periods. The returns would be lower without the expense caps. You may obtain the Fund’s most recently available month-end performance by calling 800 523-1918 or by visiting our website at delawarefunds.com/performance.

Calendar year-by-year total return (Class A)



During the periods illustrated in this bar chart, Class A’s highest quarterly return was 35.10% for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, and its lowest quarterly return was -26.90% for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2008. The maximum Class A sales charge of 5.75%, which is normally deducted when you purchase shares, is not reflected in the highest/lowest quarterly returns or in the bar chart. If this fee were included, the returns would be less than those shown. The average annual total returns in the table below do include the sales charge.

Tax information

The Fund’s distributions generally are taxable to you as ordinary income, capital gains, or some combination of both, unless you are investing through a tax-advantaged arrangement, such as a 401(k) plan or an IRA, in which case your distributions may be taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn from the tax-advantaged account.

Payments to broker/dealers and other financial intermediaries

If you purchase shares of the Fund through a broker/dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank), the Fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by influencing the broker/dealer or other intermediary and your salesperson to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your salesperson or visit your financial intermediary’s website for more information.
