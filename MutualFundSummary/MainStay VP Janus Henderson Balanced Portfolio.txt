MainStay VP Janus Henderson Balanced Portfolio

(formerly known as MainStay VP Janus Balanced Portfolio)

Investment Objective
The Portfolio seeks long-term capital growth, consistent with preservation of capital and balanced by current income.

Fees and Expenses of the Portfolio
The table below describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold shares of the Portfolio. The table does not include any separate account or policy fees or charges imposed under the variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies for which the Portfolio is an investment option. If they were included, your costs would be higher. Investors should consult the applicable variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy prospectus for more information.

Example
The Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example does not include any separate account or policy fees or charges imposed under the variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies for which the Portfolio is an investment option. If they were included, your costs would be higher. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated whether or not you redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your investment has a 5% return each year and that the Portfolio's operating expenses remain the same. The Example reflects the contractual fee waiver and/or expense reimbursement arrangement, if applicable, for the current duration of the arrangement only. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These costs, which are not reflected in annual Portfolio operating expenses or in the Example, affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 73% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The Portfolio pursues its investment objective by normally investing 35-65% of its assets in equity securities and the remaining assets in fixed-income securities and cash equivalents. The Portfolio normally invests at least 25% of its assets in fixed-income senior securities. Fixed-income securities may include corporate debt securities, U.S. government obligations, mortgage-backed securities and other mortgage-related products, and short-term securities. The Portfolio will limit its investment in high-yield/high-risk bonds, also known as “junk bonds” to 35% or less of its net assets.

In choosing investments for the Portfolio, Janus Capital Management LLC, the Portfolio's Subadvisor, applies a "bottom up" approach with certain portfolio managers focusing on the equity portion of the Portfolio and the other portfolio managers focusing on the fixed-income portion of the Portfolio. In other words, the portfolio managers look at companies one at a time to determine if a company is an attractive investment opportunity and if it is consistent with the Portfolio's investment policies. The portfolio managers may also consider economic factors, such as the effect of interest rates on certain of the Portfolio’s fixed-income investments. The portfolio managers share day-to-day responsibility for the Portfolio's investments.

The Portfolio may invest in foreign equity and debt securities, which may include investments in emerging markets.

Principal Risks
You can lose money by investing in the Portfolio. An investment in the Portfolio is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. The investments selected by the Portfolio’s Subadvisor may

underperform the market or other investments. The Portfolio may receive large purchase or redemption orders which may have adverse effects on performance if the Portfolio were required to sell securities, invest cash or hold a relatively large amount of cash at times when it would not otherwise do so.

The principal risks of investing in the Portfolio are summarized below.

Market Risk: The value of the Portfolio's investments may fluctuate because of changes in the markets in which the Portfolio invests, which could cause the Portfolio to underperform other funds with similar investment objectives and strategies. Changes in these markets may be rapid and unpredictable. From time to time, markets may experience periods of stress for potentially prolonged periods that may result in: (i) increased market volatility; (ii) reduced market liquidity; and (iii) increased redemptions of Portfolio shares. Such conditions may add significantly to the risk of volatility in the net asset value of the Portfolio's shares.

Portfolio Management Risk: The investment strategies, practices and risk analysis used by the Subadvisor may not produce the desired results. In addition, the Portfolio may not achieve its investment objective, including during a period in which the Subadvisor takes temporary positions in response to unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, or other unusual or abnormal circumstances.

Equity Securities Risk: Investments in common stocks and other equity securities are particularly subject to the risk of changing economic, stock market, industry and company conditions and the risks inherent in the portfolio managers' ability to anticipate such changes that can adversely affect the value of the Portfolio's holdings. Opportunity for greater gain often comes with greater risk of loss.

Growth Stock Risk: If growth companies do not increase their earnings at a rate expected by investors, the market price of the stock may decline significantly, even if earnings show an absolute increase. Growth company stocks also typically lack the dividend yield that can cushion stock prices in market downturns.

Debt Securities Risk: The risks of investing in debt or fixed-income securities include (without limitation): (i) credit risk, e.g., the issuer or guarantor of a debt security may be unable or unwilling (or be perceived as unable or unwilling) to make timely principal and/or interest payments or otherwise honor its obligations; (ii) maturity risk, e.g., a debt security with a longer maturity may fluctuate in value more than one with a shorter maturity; (iii) market risk, e.g., low demand for debt securities may negatively impact their price; (iv) interest rate risk, e.g., when interest rates go up, the value of a debt security generally goes down, and when interest rates go down, the value of a debt security generally goes up (long-term debt securities are generally more susceptible to interest rate risk than short-term debt securities); and (v) call risk, e.g., during a period of falling interest rates, the issuer may redeem a security by repaying it early, which may reduce the Portfolio’s income if the proceeds are reinvested at lower interest rates.

Interest rates in the United States are near historic lows, and the Portfolio currently faces a heightened level of interest rate risk. To the extent the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“Federal Reserve Board”) continues to raise the federal funds rate, there is a risk that interest rates across the financial system may rise, possibly significantly and/or rapidly. Rising interest rates or lack of market participants may lead to decreased liquidity and increased volatility in the fixed-income or debt markets, making it more difficult for the Portfolio to sell its fixed-income or debt holdings at a time when the Subadvisor might wish to sell. Decreased liquidity in the fixed-income or debt markets also may make it more difficult to value some or all of the Portfolio’s fixed-income or debt holdings.

Not all U.S. government debt securities are guaranteed by the U.S. government—some are backed only by the issuing agency, which must rely on its own resources to repay the debt. The Portfolio's yield will fluctuate with changes in short-term interest rates.

Mortgage-Related and Other Asset-Backed Securities Risk: Investments in mortgage-related securities (such as mortgage-backed securities) and other asset-backed securities generally involve a stream of payments based on the underlying obligations. These payments, which are often part interest and part return of principal, vary based on the rate at which the underlying borrowers repay their loans or other obligations. Asset-backed securities are subject to the risk that borrowers may default on the underlying obligations and that, during periods of falling interest rates, these obligations may be called or prepaid and, during periods of rising interest rates, obligations may be paid more slowly than expected. Impairment of the underlying obligations or collateral, such as by non-payment, will reduce the security's value. Enforcing rights against such collateral in events of default may be difficult or insufficient. The value of these securities may be significantly affected by changes in interest rates, the market's perception of issuers, and the creditworthiness of the parties involved. The ability of the Portfolio to successfully utilize these instruments may depend on the ability of the Subadvisor to forecast interest rates and other economic factors correctly. These securities may have a structure that makes their reaction to interest rate changes and other factors difficult to predict, making their value highly volatile.

Mortgage Pass-Through Securities Risk: Investments in mortgage pass-through securities are subject to similar market risks for fixed-income securities which include, but are not limited to, interest rate risk, credit risk, prepayment risk, and extension risk.

Foreign Securities Risk: Investments in foreign securities may be riskier than investments in U.S. securities. Differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes and securities markets, including less stringent investor protections and disclosure standards of some foreign markets, less liquid trading markets and political and economic developments in foreign countries, may affect the value of the Portfolio's investments in foreign securities. Foreign securities may also subject the Portfolio's investments to changes in currency rates. Changes in the value of foreign currencies may make the return on an investment go up or down, unrelated to the quality or performance of the investment itself.

Emerging Markets Risk: The risks related to investing in foreign securities are generally greater with respect to securities of companies that conduct their business activities in emerging markets or whose securities are traded principally in emerging markets. The risks of investing in emerging markets include the risks of illiquidity, increased price volatility, smaller market capitalizations, less government regulation, less extensive and less frequent accounting, financial and other reporting requirements, risk of loss resulting from problems in share registration and custody, substantial economic and political disruptions and the nationalization of foreign deposits or assets.

High-Yield Securities Risk: Investments in high-yield securities or non-investment grade securities (commonly referred to as "junk bonds") are considered speculative because they present a greater risk of loss than higher quality securities. Such securities may, under certain circumstances, be less liquid than higher rated securities. These securities pay investors a premium (a high interest rate or yield) because of the potential illiquidity and increased risk of loss. These securities can also be subject to greater price volatility. In times of unusual or adverse market, economic or political conditions, these securities may experience higher than normal default rates.

Liquidity and Valuation Risk: Securities purchased by the Portfolio may be illiquid at the time of purchase or liquid at the time of purchase and subsequently become illiquid due to, among other things, events relating to the issuer of the securities, market events, operational issues, economic conditions, investor perceptions or lack of market participants. The lack of an active trading market may make it difficult to sell or obtain an accurate price for a security. If market conditions or issuer specific developments make it difficult to value securities, the Portfolio may value these securities using more subjective methods, such as fair value pricing. In such cases, the value determined for a security could be different than the value realized upon such security's sale. As a result, an investor could pay more than the market value when buying Portfolio shares or receive less than the market value when selling Portfolio shares. This could affect the proceeds of any redemption or the number of shares an investor receives upon purchase. Liquidity risk may also refer to the risk that the Portfolio may not be able to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period because of unusual market conditions, unusually high volume of redemptions, or other reasons. To meet redemption requests or to raise cash to pursue other investment opportunities, the Portfolio may be forced to sell securities at an unfavorable time and/or under unfavorable conditions, which may adversely affect the Portfolio.

Money Market/Short-Term Securities Risk: To the extent the Portfolio holds cash or invests in money market or short-term securities, the Portfolio may be less likely to achieve its investment objective. In addition, it is possible that the Portfolio's investments in these instruments could lose money.

Past Performance
The following bar chart and table indicate some of the risks of investing in the Portfolio. The bar chart shows you how the Portfolio's calendar year performance has varied over the life of the Portfolio. The average annual total returns table shows how the Portfolio’s average annual total returns for the one- and five-year periods and for the life of the Portfolio compare to those of two broad-based securities market indices as well as a composite index. Separate variable annuity and variable universal life insurance account and policy fees and charges are not reflected in the bar chart and table. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. The Portfolio has selected the Standard & Poor’s 500® Index (“S&P 500® Index”) as its primary benchmark. The S&P 500® Index is widely regarded as the standard index for measuring large-cap U.S. stock market performance. The Portfolio has selected the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index as its secondary benchmark. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is a broad-based benchmark that measures the investment-grade, U.S. dollar denominated, fixed-rate taxable bond market, including Treasuries, government-related and corporate securities, mortgage-backed securities (agency fixed-rate and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage pass-throughs), asset-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The Portfolio has selected the Janus Balanced Composite Index as an additional benchmark. The Janus Balanced Composite Index is comprised of the S&P 500® Index and the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index weighted 55%/45%, respectively.

Performance data for the classes varies based on differences in their fee and expense structures. Past performance is not necessarily an indication of how the Portfolio will perform in the future.

How to Purchase and Sell Shares
Shares of the Portfolio are currently offered to certain separate accounts to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by New York Life Insurance and Annuity Corporation ("NYLIAC") and may also be offered to fund variable annuity policies and variable universal life insurance policies issued by other insurance companies. Shares of the Portfolio are also offered as underlying investments of the MainStay VP Asset Allocation Portfolios ("Asset Allocation Portfolios").

Individual investors do not transact directly with the Portfolio to purchase and redeem shares. Rather, investors select underlying investment options offered by the applicable policy. Please refer to the prospectus for the variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy that offers the Portfolio as an underlying investment option for information on the allocation of premium payments and on transfers among the investment divisions of the separate account.

Tax Information
Because the Portfolio's shareholders are the separate accounts of NYLIAC or other insurance companies through which you purchased your variable annuity policy or variable universal life insurance policy and the Asset Allocation Portfolios, no discussion is included here as to the federal income tax consequences at the shareholder level. For information concerning the federal income tax consequences to variable annuity and variable universal life insurance policy owners, consult the prospectus relating to the appropriate policy.
