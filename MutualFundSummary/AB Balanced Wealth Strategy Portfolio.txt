AB VPS BALANCED WEALTH STRATEGY PORTFOLIO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The Portfolio's investment objective is to maximize total return consistent
with the Adviser's determination of reasonable risk.

FEES AND EXPENSES OF THE PORTFOLIO

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy and hold
shares of the Portfolio. Because the information does not reflect deductions at
the separate account level or contract level for any charges that may be
incurred under a contract, Contractholders that invest in the Portfolio should
refer to the variable contract prospectus for a description of fees and
expenses that apply to Contractholders. Inclusion of these charges would
increase the fees and expenses provided below.

EXAMPLES

The Examples are intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Portfolio with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Examples assume
that you invest $10,000 in the Portfolio for the time periods indicated and
then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Examples also
assume that your investment has a 5% return each year, that the Portfolio's
operating expenses stay the same and that any fee waivers remain in effect for
only one year. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on
these assumptions your costs would be:

PORTFOLIO TURNOVER

The Portfolio pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys or
sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover
rate may indicate higher transaction costs. These transaction costs, which are
not reflected in the Annual Portfolio Operating Expenses or in the Examples,
affect the Portfolio's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the
Portfolio's portfolio turnover rate was 108% of the average value of its
portfolio.


PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES

The Portfolio invests in a portfolio of equity and fixed-income securities that
is designed as a solution for investors who seek a moderate tilt toward equity
returns but also want the risk diversification offered by fixed-income
securities and the broad diversification of their equity risk across styles,
capitalization ranges and geographic regions. Under normal circumstances, the
Portfolio will invest at


38

<PAGE>



least 25% of its total assets in equity securities and at least 25% of its
total assets in fixed-income securities with a goal of providing moderate
upside potential without excessive volatility. The Portfolio also seeks
exposure to real assets by investing in real estate-related equity securities
(including real estate investment trusts, or REITs), natural resource equity
securities and inflation-sensitive equity securities, which are equity
securities of companies that the Adviser believes maintain or grow margins in
rising inflation environments, including equity securities of utilities and
infrastructure-related companies ("inflation sensitive equities"). The
Portfolio pursues a global strategy, typically investing in securities of
issuers located in the United States and in other countries throughout the
world, including emerging market countries.



The Adviser expects that the Portfolio will normally invest a greater
percentage of its total assets in equity securities than in fixed-income
securities, and will generally invest in equity securities both directly and
through underlying investment companies advised by the Adviser ("Underlying
Portfolios"). A significant portion of the Portfolio's assets are expected to
be invested directly in U.S. large-cap equity securities, primarily common
stocks, in accordance with the Adviser's U.S. Strategic Equities investment
strategy ("U.S. Strategic Equities"). Under U.S. Strategic Equities, portfolio
managers of the Adviser that specialize in various investment disciplines
identify high-conviction large-cap equity securities based on their fundamental
investment research for potential investment by the Portfolio. These securities
are then assessed in terms of both this fundamental research and quantitative
analysis in creating the equity portion of the Portfolio's portfolio. In
applying the quantitative analysis, the Adviser considers a number of metrics
that historically have provided some indication of favorable future returns,
including metrics related to valuation, quality, investor behavior and
corporate behavior.



In addition, the Portfolio seeks to achieve exposure to international large-cap
equity securities through investments in the INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIC EQUITIES
PORTFOLIO of BERNSTEIN FUND, INC. ("Bernstein International Strategic Equities
Portfolio") and the INTERNATIONAL PORTFOLIO of SANFORD C. BERNSTEIN FUND, INC.
("SCB International Portfolio"), each a registered investment company advised
by the Adviser. Bernstein International Strategic Equities Portfolio and SCB
International Portfolio focus on investing in non-U.S. large-cap and mid-cap
equity securities. Bernstein International Strategic Equities Portfolio follows
a strategy similar to U.S. Strategic Equities, but in the international
context. In managing SCB International Portfolio, the Adviser selects stocks by
drawing on the capabilities of its separate investment teams specializing in
different investment disciplines, including value, growth, stability and
others. The Portfolio also invests in other Underlying Portfolios to
efficiently gain exposure to certain other types of equity securities,
including small- and mid-cap and emerging market equity securities. The Adviser
selects an Underlying Portfolio based on the segment of the equity market to
which the Underlying Portfolio provides exposure, its investment philosophy,
and how it complements and diversifies the Portfolio's overall portfolio.





In selecting fixed-income investments, the Adviser may draw on the capabilities
of separate investment teams that specialize in different areas that are
generally defined by the maturity of the debt securities and/or their ratings,
and which may include subspecialties (such as inflation-indexed securities).
These fixed-income teams draw on the resources and expertise of the Adviser's
internal fixed-income research staff, which includes over 50 dedicated
fixed-income research analysts and economists. The Portfolio's fixed-income
securities will primarily be investment-grade debt securities, but are expected
to include lower-rated securities ("junk bonds") and preferred stock.



The Portfolio expects to enter into derivative transactions, such as options,
futures contracts, forwards and swaps. Derivatives may provide a more efficient
and economical exposure to market segments than direct investments, and may
also be a more efficient way to alter the Portfolio's exposure. The Portfolio
may, for example, use credit default, interest rate and total return swaps to
establish exposure to the fixed-income markets or particular fixed-income
securities and, as noted below, may use currency derivatives to hedge foreign
currency exposure.



The Adviser may employ currency hedging strategies in the Portfolio or the
Underlying Portfolios, including the use of currency-related derivatives, to
seek to reduce currency risk in the Portfolio or the Underlying Portfolios, but
it is not required to do so. The Adviser will generally employ currency hedging
strategies more frequently in the fixed-income portion of the Portfolio than in
the equity portion.


PRINCIPAL RISKS:
.  MARKET RISK: The value of the Portfolio's assets will fluctuate as the stock
   or bond market fluctuates. The value of its investments may decline,
   sometimes rapidly and unpredictably, simply because of economic changes or
   other events that affect large portions of the market.


.  ALLOCATION RISK: The allocation of investments among the different
   investment styles, such as growth or value, equity or debt securities, or
   U.S. or non-U.S. securities may have a more significant effect on the
   Portfolio's net asset value, or NAV, when one of these investment strategies
   is performing more poorly than others.



.  FOREIGN (NON-U.S.) RISK: Investments in securities of non-U.S. issuers may
   involve more risk than those of U.S. issuers. These securities may fluctuate
   more widely in price and may be less liquid due to adverse market, economic,
   political, regulatory or other factors. These risks may be heightened with
   respect to investments in emerging market countries, where there may be an
   increased amount of economic, political and social instability.


                                                                             39

<PAGE>




.  CURRENCY RISK: Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect
   the value of the Portfolio's investments in securities denominated in
   foreign currencies or reduce the Portfolio's returns.


.  INTEREST RATE RISK: Changes in interest rates will affect the value of
   investments in fixed-income securities. When interest rates rise, the value
   of existing investments in fixed-income securities tends to fall and this
   decrease in value may not be offset by higher income from new investments.
   The Portfolio may be subject to heightened interest rate risk due to rising
   rates as the current period of historically low interest rates may be
   ending. Interest rate risk is generally greater for fixed-income securities
   with longer maturities or durations.


.  CREDIT RISK: An issuer or guarantor of a fixed-income security, or the
   counterparty to a derivatives or other contract, may be unable or unwilling
   to make timely payments of interest or principal, or to otherwise honor its
   obligations. The issuer or guarantor may default, causing a loss of the full
   principal amount of a security and accrued interest. The degree of risk for
   a particular security may be reflected in its credit rating. There is the
   possibility that the credit rating of a fixed-income security may be
   downgraded after purchase, which may adversely affect the value of the
   security.


.  BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITY RISK: Investments in fixed-income securities
   with lower ratings ("junk bonds") tend to have a higher probability that an
   issuer will default or fail to meet its payment obligations. These
   securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as
   specific corporate developments, interest rate sensitivity, negative
   perceptions of the junk bond market generally and less secondary market
   liquidity.



.  CAPITALIZATION RISK: Investments in small- and mid-capitalization companies
   may be more volatile than investments in large-capitalization companies.
   Investments in small-capitalization companies may have additional risks
   because these companies have limited product lines, markets or financial
   resources.


.  INVESTMENT IN OTHER INVESTMENT COMPANIES RISK: As with other investments,
   investments in other investment companies are subject to market and
   selection risk. In addition, Contractholders invested in the Portfolio bear
   both their proportionate share of expenses in the Portfolio (including
   management fees) and, indirectly, the expenses of the investment companies
   (to the extent these expenses are not waived or reimbursed by the Adviser).


.  DERIVATIVES RISK: Derivatives may be illiquid, difficult to price, and
   leveraged so that small changes may produce disproportionate losses for the
   Portfolio, and may be subject to counterparty risk to a greater degree than
   more traditional investments.


.  REAL ASSETS RISK: The Portfolio's investments in securities linked to real
   assets involve significant risks, including financial, operating, and
   competitive risks. Investments in securities linked to real assets expose
   the Portfolio to adverse macroeconomic conditions, such as a rise in
   interest rates or a downturn in the economy in which the asset is located.
   Changes in inflation rates or in the market's inflation expectations may
   adversely affect the market value of inflation-sensitive equities. The
   Portfolio's investments in real estate securities have many of the same
   risks as direct ownership of real estate, including the risk that the value
   of real estate could decline due to a variety of factors that affect the
   real estate market generally. Investments in REITs may have additional
   risks. REITs are dependent on the capability of their managers, may have
   limited diversification, and could be significantly affected by changes in
   tax laws.



.  ACTIVE TRADING RISK: The Portfolio expects to engage in active and frequent
   trading of its portfolio securities and its portfolio turnover rate is
   expected to exceed 100%. A higher rate of portfolio turnover increases
   transaction costs, which may negatively affect the Portfolio's return. In
   addition, a high rate of portfolio turnover may result in substantial
   short-term gains, which may have adverse tax consequences for
   Contractholders.


.  MANAGEMENT RISK: The Portfolio is subject to management risk because it is
   an actively-managed investment fund. The Adviser will apply its investment
   techniques and risk analyses in making investment decisions for the
   Portfolio, but there is no guarantee that its techniques will produce the
   intended results.

As with all investments, you may lose money by investing in the Portfolio.

BAR CHART AND PERFORMANCE INFORMATION
The bar chart and performance information provide an indication of the
historical risk of an investment in the Portfolio by showing:

.  how the Portfolio's performance changed from year to year over ten years; and

.  how the Portfolio's average annual returns for one, five and ten years
   compare to those of a broad-based securities market index.

The performance information does not take into account separate account
charges. If separate account charges were included, an investor's return would
be lower. The Portfolio's past performance, of course, does not necessarily
indicate how it will perform in the future.


EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2018, THE PORTFOLIO AMENDED ITS PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES BY
ELIMINATING THE STATIC TARGETS FOR ALLOCATION OF INVESTMENTS AMONG ASSET
CLASSES, CHANGING THE SECURITIES SELECTION STRATEGIES USED FOR THE EQUITY
PORTION OF THE PORTFOLIO, AND BROADENING THE TYPES OF REAL ASSET SECURITIES IN
WHICH THE PORTFOLIO WILL INVEST. THE PERFORMANCE SHOWN BELOW FOR PERIODS PRIOR
TO MAY 1, 2018 IS BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO'S PRIOR PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES AND MAY
NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PORTFOLIO'S PERFORMANCE UNDER ITS CURRENT
PRINCIPAL STRATEGIES.
