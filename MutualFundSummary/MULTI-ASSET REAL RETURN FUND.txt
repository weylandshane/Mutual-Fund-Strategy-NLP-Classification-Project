Example 
The example below is intended to help you compare the costs of investing in the fund with the costs of investing in other mutual funds. The example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods, and that you earn a 5% return each year. The example also assumes that the fund’s operating expenses remain the same . You may be required to pay brokerage commissions on your purchases of Investor or I Class shares of the fund, which are not reflected in the example. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover
The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 160% of the average value of its portfolio.

Principal Investment Strategies
The fund’s asset allocation strategy seeks to diversify its investments among equity securities, debt securities, U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed securities, commodity-related investments and real estate-related investments, all in an effort to provide investors total real return. Total real return is total return reduced by the expected impact of inflation. The fund’s investment strategy has been designed in an effort to protect the fund’s investors from the effects of rising U.S. inflation. The portfolio managers will regularly review the fund’s asset mix and adjust the allocation among asset classes as necessary to provide the fund what they believe is the most favorable outlook for achieving the fund’s objective. By adjusting the allocation among asset classes the portfolio managers can moderate risks associated with each asset category.
The fund may invest a portion of its assets in equity securities of U.S. or foreign issuers, including issuers located in emerging markets. Equity securities include common stock, preferred stock, and equity-equivalent securities, such as convertible securities, stock futures contracts or stock index futures contracts.
To help protect against U.S. inflation, the fund may invest a portion of its assets in inflation-indexed debt securities. These securities include inflation-indexed U.S. Treasury securities, inflation-indexed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities other than the U.S. Treasury, and inflation-indexed securities issued by other entities such as corporations. The fund may also protect against inflation by entering into inflation swaps.
The portfolio managers may also purchase other debt securities that are not linked to inflation. These debt securities may be payable in U.S. or foreign currencies, including emerging markets debt, and may include securities that are rated below investment grade (also known as “high-yield securities” or “junk bonds”). The fund may also invest in bank loans and mortgage- or asset-backed securities (including collateralized debt obligations).
The fund also may invest a portion of its assets in commodity-related investments. Commodities are assets that have tangible properties, such as oil, metals and agricultural products. Under normal market conditions, the fund’s commodity-related investments will be allocated between equity securities of U.S. and foreign companies engaged in commodity-related businesses and investments that provide investment exposure to underlying investible commodities, such as commodity-linked notes and exchange traded funds (ETFs).
The fund may also invest a portion of its assets in global real estate-related investments by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs), REIT ETFs and equity securities issued by companies engaged in the real estate industry. A company is considered a real estate company if, in the opinion of the portfolio managers, at least 50% of its revenues or 50% of the market value of its assets at the time the securities are purchased by the fund are attributed to the ownership, construction, management or sale of real estate.
The fund may invest in derivative instruments for both hedging and non-hedging (i.e., to enhance returns) purposes.  The fund's derivative instruments may include futures contracts, options, swaps, and forward currency contracts, including non-deliverable forwards (NDFs). When entering into derivatives positions, the fund will be required to segregate assets to cover such obligations at levels consistent with the guidance of the SEC.
The fund intends to actively manage currency exposure through a currency overlay strategy. The currency overlay strategy is intended to enhance returns by increasing exposure to a foreign currency or shifting exposure to the fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies from one foreign currency to another foreign currency. This strategy may use a combination of foreign currency forward contracts and NDFs.
To gain exposure to the various asset classes, the fund may invest in varying combinations of unaffiliated funds such as ETFs, securities and other financial instruments.
The fund may engage in active and frequent trading of portfolio securities to achieve its principal investment strategies. A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may affect the fund’s performance. Higher portfolio turnover also may result in the realization and distribution of capital gains, including short-term capital gains.
Principal Risks
•
Style Risk — If at any time the market is not favoring the fund’s investment style, which is designed for high and rising inflationary cycles, the fund’s gains may not be as big as, or its losses may be bigger than, those of other funds using different investment styles.
•
Real Interest Rate Risk — Inflation-indexed securities trade at prevailing real, or after-inflation, interest rates. Changes in real interest rates affect the value of such securities. Generally, when real interest rates rise, the value of the fund’s fixed-income securities will decline. The opposite is true when real interest rates decline. A period of rising interest rates may negatively affect the fund’s performance.
•
Credit Risk — The value of the fund’s fixed-income securities will be affected adversely by any erosion, or perceived erosion, in the ability of the issuers of these securities to make interest and principal payments as they become due.
•
Foreign Securities Risk — The fund invests in foreign securities, which are generally riskier than U.S. securities. As a result, the fund is subject to foreign risk, meaning that political events (such as civil unrest, national elections and imposition of exchange controls), social and economic events (such as labor strikes and rising inflation), and natural disasters occurring in a country where

3


the fund invests could cause the fund’s investments in that country to experience gains or losses. Because of these risks, and others, securities of foreign issuers may be less liquid, more volatile, and harder to value than U.S. securities.
•
Currency Risk — The fund is subject to the risk of a decline in the value of a foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar, which reduces the dollar value of securities denominated in that currency. The overall impact on the fund’s holdings may be significant depending on the currencies represented in the portfolio, how each one appreciates or depreciates in relation to the U.S. dollar, and whether currency positions are hedged. Currency trends can be volatile, and to the extent the fund purchases and sells currencies, it will also be subject to the risk that its trading strategies, including efforts at hedging, will not succeed.
•
Bank Loan Risk — The market for bank loans may not be highly liquid and the fund may have difficulty selling them. In connection with purchasing loan participations, the fund generally will have no right to enforce compliance by borrowers with loan terms nor any set off rights, and the fund may not benefit directly from any posted collateral. As a result, the fund may be subject to the credit risk of both the borrower and the lender selling the participation. Bank loan transactions may take more than seven days to settle, meaning that proceeds would be unavailable to make additional investments or meet redemptions.
•
Collateralized Debt Obligations Risk — Collateralized debt obligations and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) are subject to credit, interest rate, valuation, and prepayment and extension risks. These securities also are subject to risk of default on the underlying asset, particularly during periods of economic downturn. The market value of CLOs may be affected by, among other things, changes in the market value of the underlying assets held by the CLO, changes in the distributions on the underlying assets, defaults and recoveries on the underlying assets, capital gains and losses on the underlying assets, prepayments on underlying assets and the availability, prices and interest rate of underlying assets.
•
Commodity Investing Risk - The fund’s commodity-related investments may be subject to greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of the fund’s commodity-related investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, interest rate changes, and volatility in commodity-related indexes. The value of these investments may also be affected by factors affecting a particular commodity, such as weather, disease, embargoes, tariffs, taxes and economic, political and regulatory developments.
•
Real Estate Investing — An investment in the fund may be subject to many of the same risks as a direct investment in real estate. These risks include changes in economic conditions, interest rates, property values, property tax increases, overbuilding and increased competition, environmental contamination, zoning and natural disasters. This is due to the fact that the value of the fund’s investments may be affected by the value of the real estate owned by the companies in which it invests.
•
Emerging Market Risk — Investing in securities of companies located in emerging market countries generally is also riskier than investing in securities of companies located in foreign developed countries. Emerging market countries may have unstable governments and/or economies that are subject to sudden change. These changes may be magnified by the countries’ emergent financial markets, resulting in significant volatility to investments in these countries.
•
Derivative Risk - The use of derivative instruments involves risks different from, or possibly greater than, the risks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional instruments. Derivatives are subject to a number of risks, including liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, and correlation risk. Derivative transactions may expose the fund to the effects of leverage, which could increase the fund's exposure to the market and magnify potential losses, particularly when derivatives are used to enhance return rather than offset risk. Derivatives can also be highly illiquid and difficult to unwind or value, and changes in the value of a derivative held by the fund may not correlate with the value of the underlying instrument or the fund’s other investments.
•
Liquidity Risk — The fund may also be subject to liquidity risk. During periods of market turbulence or unusually low trading activity, in order to meet redemptions it may be necessary for the fund to sell securities at prices that could have an adverse effect on the fund’s share price. Changing regulatory and market conditions, including increases in interest rates and credit spreads may adversely affect the liquidity of the fund’s investments.
•
Market Risk — The value of the fund’s shares will go up and down based on the performance of the companies whose securities it owns and other factors generally affecting the securities market.
•
Price Volatility — The value of the fund’s shares may fluctuate significantly in the short term.
•
Principal Loss — At any given time your shares may be worth less than the price you paid for them. In other words, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
An investment in the fund is not a bank deposit, and it is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government agency.

Historical performance for the R5 Class prior to its inception is based on the performance of I Class shares, which have the same expenses as the R5 Class shares.
The after-tax returns are shown only for Investor Class shares. After-tax returns for other share classes will vary. After-tax returns are calculated using the historical highest individual federal marginal income tax rates and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor’s tax situation and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or IRAs.

If you purchase the fund through a broker-dealer or other financial intermediary (such as a bank, insurance company, plan sponsor or financial professional), the fund and its related companies may pay the intermediary for the sale of fund shares and related services.
